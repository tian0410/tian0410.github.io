He is facing significant emotional and behavioral challenges. I’ve been reading your articles recently, and they’ve been quite enlightening. Being a well-known dad like yourself, I find your words deeply moving and greatly appreciate your wisdom and profound insights.<br>My son started speaking at three years old, has been to various institutions, and attended kindergarten. Just as you mentioned, I’ve noticed a shift from a seemingly simple autistic child to one exhibiting signs of neurosis. After reaching a point where he could imitate speech, he seems to have hit a roadblock and now has only a limited amount of active language.<br>His mood and behavior have become more serious, and I understand this is likely because his thinking hasn’t progressed further. His current behavior is quite ‘rebellious,’ and there are several aspects that are particularly concerning:<br>1.As you highlighted in your article, the channels of communication for children seem blocked, making it challenging for them to accept external information. They struggle to comprehend or listen, often resulting in aggressive behaviors. For instance, the persistently extreme spitting behavior, ongoing for over two years, has become a source of distress. The spitting has become more frequent, serving various purposes such as retaliation against denial, seeking attention, or expressing irritation. There are instances where he directly spits in my face. Attempts to communicate or reason with him prove futile, and subsequent occurrences remain unchanged. The parent-child relationship has deteriorated to a point I never anticipated, prompting deep self-reflection. I used to exert force in enforcing desktop learning both at institutions and home, with a rather strong attitude. In the institution, some sensory integration teachers resorted to physical punishment. Given the pressure of quitting my job to care for the children, I occasionally resorted to beating and scolding. Now, I realize that the increasing emotional distance from the child may be significantly linked to these experiences.<br>2.Given the freedom to play, the child’s preferred activities involve climbing bookshelves, cabinets, and playing with power plugs. Climbing to the top of shelves or cabinets, he tends to sweep items like books or clothes onto the floor. I question whether creating a mess in the room brings him satisfaction, as he engages in these activities whenever he has free time. Regarding power plugs, he insists on unplugging them, especially when he sees me charging a device or using the air conditioner. Despite attempts to communicate, he remains unresponsive.<br>3.He falls asleep independently, but upon checking on him, I find him sleeping naked. However, he readily accepts putting on clothes when assisted. I contemplate whether this is an expression of a long-suppressed desire seeking release.<br>4.His thought processes are disorganized and lack clear rules. Examples include urinating in unusual places, such as his car, while being completely naked. Another instance is his habit of picking up and eating things while walking, even when engaged in conversation.<br>I’ve been contemplating the significance of addressing the channel issue as a means to alleviate loneliness. However, many of his actions seem to defy established rules. I wholeheartedly align with your perspective on satisfying children, but I’m grappling with how to effectively intertwine meeting his needs with the establishment of rules. Despite continuous reflection, I haven’t discovered a more effective approach. I believe this demands skill and wisdom. Could you please offer some guidance? Thank you!<br>Dad Hamper: I think that since we have an autistic child, we have also had problems with our vision. All the children’s behaviors are no longer right. Things that we didn’t care about before now start to care about them, and things that used to be right are now no longer right. What should I do if something goes wrong? Then correct it! How to correct it? Stopping children from behaving like that is the worst method most commonly used by parents! If a child is treated like this from an early age, the child will have more and more problematic behaviors when he grows up. Why? Because he went crazy because he was blocked, and his problematic behaviors were all caused by being blocked.<br>It is impossible for a person to accept the fate of being blocked. He will try to get out with the strongest strength. Think about it, if you want others to block you in this way, and if you want others to block you in that way, can you not be crazy? Others will say that what you do is wrong, so they block you to correct you! But you don’t know that what you are doing is wrong. If you know that what you are doing is wrong, you have some ability to correct yourself. What’s more, if you think you are doing the right thing, or if you see the part you are facing, but others deny you, can you not be angry? Why do people always find excuses for themselves? It is to make others feel that they are right. This is the reason for negative reinforcement.<br>I remember six years ago, when Hamp was just like this, I saw a father list the “Ten Don’ts” for his children. First, don’t allow … ; second, don’t allow … ; third, don’t allow. … ; … , tenth, not allowed … . I can’t remember exactly what it was, and I didn’t even have the intention to remember it at the time. In the blink of an eye, our children have grown up in six years. What is the state of his children now?<br>Rather than saying that I have been correcting my child these years, it is better to say that I have been respecting his rights as a human being. One parent severely accused me of doting on my children. Yes, I dote on my children in my heart. I really haven’t thought too much about autism. I once said to my child’s mother, “I’ll just spoil him to death, and I won’t do anything to correct him.” I don’t think I should stop pampering him just because he is autistic. He is still a little kid and I want to pamper my kid. Another thing I pay special attention to is that if the child’s ability cannot improve, such a big deal will actually harm the child. Pampering a child while continuously improving his abilities is respecting his rights as a person. Therefore, respecting a person is not a concept, but a technology. Without technology, there is no respect.<br>Han Pu’s heart is connected to the outside world, so Han Pu is free. If a person is unblocked, it doesn’t matter whether he is autistic or not. Unblocked is more important than the correction of autism. I wonder if correction is just for smoothness? Correction is not just to scare the child. Regardless of whether it is corrected or not, I think allowing children to have unobstructed children is humane, and not allowing children to unobstructed is anti-human. If there is no passage between a person and the outside world or the passage is blocked, can this person not be crazy? If the blood vessels in a person’s body are blocked by lumps everywhere, what kind of living situation will he be in? This is a state of existence in which life is worse than death, and death is impossible even if one wants to die.<br>I admit and accept that my child is autistic, and he will always be autistic, but I just want an autistic child to live a smoother life. In the course of my life with him, I want to make him human. I didn’t think about correcting him, I just kept giving him positive energy and letting him radiate his true self from the heart. I think I should respect him as a person in this way. I can totally imagine the future!<br>An autistic child does not want to be alone. He always wants to get out of loneliness. He has been working hard for this, and he works harder than his parents! An autistic child has the desire and actions to get out of loneliness. All the behaviors of an autistic child are his exploration of getting out of loneliness. Any behavior of a child, whether considered by parents to be bad behavior or good behavior, is the child’s exploration of getting out of loneliness. This is the total function of the child’s behavior.<br>After a child has been blocked for several years, the child will exhibit more and more intense problematic behaviors until the parent is unable to stop the behavior and the parent collapses. When parents collapse and look for solutions, times have changed. The education of autistic children depends on how you start. If you don’t set the stage well at the beginning, it will be bad all the way to the end. This is the same as playing Go. You must have the overall situation in mind at the beginning, but the overall concept comes from practice. How can you have an overall view without starting practice? This is dialectics. Practicing and summarizing every day is a weapon for me to improve my level. If there is no summary, there will be no progress. Only by constantly summarizing can we continue to discover what we have failed to do, continue to understand the essence of ABA, continue to improve ourselves, and continue to have an overall view.<br>The person I am now is much clearer than before, and the person I am in the future will definitely be at a higher level than the person I am now. Someone asked me to come and give a lecture to them. I was happy to go. Even though time was tight, I happily agreed. Why? I try to improve myself once I give a lecture. A lecture lasts four or three hours without a break. I think it will be very frustrating for the audience. My expression makes me grow, and my child’s expression makes my child grow, so I particularly value my child’s expression. Expression is the proof of smoothness. The more you express, the smoother you will be.<br>I remember that I just discovered that something was wrong with Hamp. After we went to the hospital and was diagnosed with autism, I started to pay attention to his behavior, because autism requires behavioral modification. I remembered this sentence at the time. Hamp raised his head and squinted his eyes, looking like a fool. I was very scared. I thought, how could a smart and beautiful child suddenly become a fool? If he does this behavior, I will beat him and scare him. He didn’t know what was going on. A little over three-year-old child just lived in fear. All he knew was that he was afraid of me. All he knew was that his father had changed. It turned out that he no longer had that father. He didn’t understand anything when he behaved like this. I flicked his head and shouted at him. I think my expression was enough to scare him. Sometimes he really peed his pants like this, and his pants got wet like this. The scene in the movie where I was so scared that I wet my pants really happened in reality, and I regretted it very much afterwards.<br>He’s a little older, he’s autistic, but he’s more of a little kid. He did those behaviors, but he didn’t understand anything. My desperate and hysterical look of terror would only make a three-year-old child more frightened. A normal three-year-old child still behaves like a spoiled child in the arms of his parents. Is it just because my child is autistic that he has been hit harder by me? I am his father. If a child scares his father, how can he survive? What did he do wrong? It’s not his fault that he became autistic, and he didn’t want it to be like this. But because he was autistic, he began to suffer inhuman treatment. At that time, I was still thinking about how to scare him and scare him back. I was driving and he was sitting in the back looking for kindergartens and institutions. I looked back at him sitting in the back and he didn’t know anything. I turned around and looked at him with tears streaming down my face in horror. I passed on all this fear to him. He was originally a child. When he smiled stupidly, I slapped him on the shoulder, and the legendary fingerprints immediately appeared in front of my eyes. I don’t know what happened, but I hit him on the thigh with a clothes hanger. A black and blue stain remained forever. Several years later, it is still there. I have also done the ridiculous things that other parents have done. We are just as ridiculous, terrible, ignorant and cruel. I wanted to give myself a good slap, but I couldn’t. Personality determines what I do. Even if I understand a lot of truths, my actions still reveal the dark side of my personality. I need to constantly reflect on myself and cut myself cruelly. If I do the right thing, the child will do the right thing. I once heard my doctoral supervisor say, “Men should be cruel to themselves.” I have to keep moving in a more refined and correct direction, and I have to keep cutting off my problematic behaviors.<br>In the article “Parents Don’t Hurt Their Children a Second Time”, Dabao is an ordinary child and Xiaobao is an autistic child. They play together in an inflatable castle. Dabao pressed Xiaobao down, and Xiaobao couldn’t get up after struggling for a while, so he bit Dabao. Dabao let Xiaobao up, and then told Xiaobao that he was going to beat him, and Xiaobao screamed hysterically. Xiaobao is a very kind person. A look of fear. Xiaobao’s father came over and asked Xiaobao, “What’s wrong? What happened?” Xiaobao cried and said he bit his brother. “Is this right?” his father asked Xiaobao. Xiaobao said “I was wrong”, but Xiaobao was still very angry.<br>Dabao suppresses Xiaobao, which causes Xiaobao to be hurt. Why does this hurt? Because Xiaobao is autistic, he cannot bear such suppression. Because Xiaobao’s way of getting rid of being hurt was inappropriate, he was educated by his father. The father wanted his child not to bite people in the future. Xiaobao admitted that he was wrong. This was the second time Xiaobao was hurt. In fact, this was the third injury. The first injury was when he became autistic. Because there was a first injury, there was a second injury. Because there is a second injury, there is also a third injury. It seems to be correcting the child’s behavior, but it does not understand the rationality of the child’s behavior. If you cannot see the rationality of your child’s behavior and cannot respect such rationality, there will be no correction. Any correction that fails to look at a child’s behavior in a positive light is likely to create more problematic behaviors because it violates positive thinking. Although the child is autistic, we still need to see the rationality in autism. In this sense, problem behavior is”corrected” in this way. In fact, the more we correct, the more mistakes we make, and the more we correct, the more problems we have. The word ‘correct’ can be replaced by ‘mess’, which can express the meaning better.<br>Let’s look at the question raised by the father at the beginning of this article. The child’s emotional and behavioral problems are serious. After years of intervention, why have the behaviors and emotions become more serious? How is such an intervention accomplished? Where there’s a block, there must be a release; this is differential reinforcement. Only blocking without releasing constitutes negative behavior, while only releasing without blocking is a positive mindset. The outcome of merely blocking without releasing is the exacerbation of a child’s behavioral and emotional issues. Releasing without blocking requires the development of certain tools, much like when we need to alleviate a dammed-up lake, where we need tools such as excavators. I wanted Hamp to be able to say some vocabulary words, so I asked him to sit down and learn from me, but he didn’t want to. If he doesn’t want to and I have to force him to sit down, this is blocking him. Isn’t it just for the purpose of blocking him to gain access to this knowledge? I didn’t go to school with the goal of sitting in class. He is autistic, and I want him to sit down and learn the knowledge, but he is unwilling to sit down, and I am unwilling to block him to prevent him from running away. I made the knowledge into a video and put it on my mobile phone. Hamp flipped through it and watched it by himself. I didn’t force him, he took the initiative to watch it. When these contents are uploaded and he is asked to sit down, he will have the ability to sit down. Only then will he be blocked to put a certain amount of pressure on him. Such pressure will not cause harm to him. Stress causes harm to children because the child’s ability cannot withstand such pressure. If the child’s ability can withstand such pressure, then such pressure is not harm. At this time, it is entering the stage of congestion and relaxation, which is the fast lane for children to progress. Later, there will be more obstruction than negligence. I will not praise him if he do good things, but it will not work if he do negative things. I have entered this stage with Hamp now, because he has already had his outlet, and he must behave accordingly. Yeah, He can’t just let it go if he understand it. This kind of pressure is equivalent to pressing a spring, which will allow children to gain momentum and make rapid progress.<br>It can be said that intervention needs to go through three stages sequentially: having a release, having both a release and a block, and having a block. These stages follow the order of positive reinforcement, differential reinforcement, and negative reinforcement. However, if the third stage is placed at the beginning, it will lead towards more emotional and behavioral problems. When a child exhibits negative behavior, and a parent blocks it, the child responds with another negative behavior, and if the parent blocks again, this becomes a cycle of continually reinforcing negative behavior through negative reinforcement.<br>The process of enhancing a child’s abilities goes from logic to behavior and then to language, but this sequence is often reversed. Parents typically try to correct a child’s behavior or impart wisdom by speaking, which is futile and can lead to more problematic behavior and language in the future. Why? Because the inherent logic hasn’t taken root within the child. I believe the order should be logic, then behavior, and finally language. Logic is the root, behavior is the trunk, and language is the branches and leaves. Seven-tenths of the effort should be at the root, two-tenths in the trunk, and one-tenth in language. Parents who don’t know how to build the root end up putting all their effort into behavior and language. Furthermore, non-verbal behavior is not executed well, so parents who rely solely on verbal communication end up with a tree that is heavily laden at the top and collapses under its own weight. Logic is conveyed through non-verbal means, and within non-verbal communication, there’s a sequence from the obvious to the subtle. I start with the most subtle aspects of logic, where silence triumphs over sound, and inaction surpasses action. It’s somewhat reminiscent of the wisdom in Laozi’s Tao Te Ching, “Act without doing, work without effort,” and I’m beginning to understand that.<br>The dad mentioned, “He falls asleep alone. But every time I went in to see him, I found that he was sleeping naked, and then I helped him put on clothes, and he accepted it.” I think if it’s acceptable, just accept it. Address the most clear and urgent issues first. Once that’s done, what about the gray areas? Children have their own internal views and behaviors; they tend to categorize the gray areas into black, gray, and white. Behavior has three stages or types: black, which is the least desirable; gray, the ambiguous zone; and white, the positive behavior. The sequence for behavior intervention is to start with the darkest, positively shaping it. If it’s something you can overlook, then let it be; maintain good behavior. If, at the beginning, you intervene in both black and gray behaviors, the child won’t understand boundaries. Parents who don’t recognize boundaries can’t teach their children to differentiate thoughts. What about sleeping naked? Should you intervene or not? How to intervene? When to intervene?<br>When a child’s behavior violates the norm, there is a shaping process. What is the ladder? There is also a cognitive issue among parents. If the behavior that violates the norm reaches the lowest level that others can accept, should they control it or ignore it? We tend to fill up the space and leave no room for children. Children no longer have the process of independent development.</p>
