When his father insisted, the four or five-year-old responded with frustration, banging his head against the wall. His aim was to encounter something painful, seeking out hard corners like switches to touch. Fearing harm, Hamp’s father intervened just before his head touched the wall, offering his hand for the child to touch. When Hamp raised his head, his father withdrew his hand.<br>In attempting to deter a child, Hamp’s father advocates for using the least force, a concept he terms “the least amount of stopping.” This approach, “minimum obstruction,” strives to grant children maximum freedom. In pursuit of touch, Hamp would maneuver to avoid his father’s hand repeatedly, and the process would continue. It’s a back-and-forth, a repetition of explanations by Daddy Hamp. This, according to him, is a form of training, and Papa Hamp finds it endlessly engaging.<br>Hamp’s father isn’t afraid of Hamp’s touch; he’s concerned about Hamp’s pain. The aim of Hamp’s father’s intervention was to address Hamp’s discomfort, not just to prevent his touch. Expressing his intentions accurately, with minimal interference, Hamp’s father’s actions align with his sentiments—no more, no less. This principle, “the heart and the actions are consistent,” ensures the clear transmission of Hamp’s father’s meaning to his children through precise actions.<br>Despite Hamp’s father’s efforts, Hamp’s goal remains to cease the behavior only when it becomes painful. Consequently, Hamp’s father finds it necessary to administer a painful touch once or twice. While he acknowledges the discomfort, Hamp’s father deems it a manageable issue, feeling the pain and ceasing the touch.<br>Rather than employing force, Hamp’s father opts for a gentler approach to coax Hamp into washing his hands. When Hamp’s head hurts upon touching, it alarms his father. The intention here is to dissuade Hamp through an understanding response. Strong parents may resort to force for control, while less assertive children might resort to self-harm to assert control over their parents. Each employs their strategies. The root of many behavioral issues in children often lies in resistance and the desire for control over their parents. Therefore, the problem isn’t the child’s behavior but the parents’ attempts to exert control. The issue lies in the parents’ inclination toward control. Ideally, parent-child relationships should be based on equality, not control.<br> Hamp’s father won’t fear if Hamp doesn’t touch him in pain, and Hamp won’t be able to control his father. To assert control over Hamp’s father, he deliberately inflicts pain, genuinely hurting him. The child’s self-injury is authentic, not feigned, as it serves as a means of controlling the parent.<br>Around the age of seven or eight, Hamp’s method of expressing anger involves taking the elevator to the 18th floor and sitting there. Subsequently, he might run to the elevator door crying. This behavior doesn’t pose harm, and Hamp’s father isn’t concerned. At approximately 12 or 13 years old, he starts going out, slamming the door behind him. Worried that the door might be forced open, Hamp’s father resorts to using some force to secure the buffer inside.<br>On one occasion, when Hamp’s father asked him to wash his hands, Hamp was on the verge of going out to vent. Offering a towel, Hamp’s father suggested wiping his hands clean. Wiping with the towel disrupted Hamp’s thoughts of going out. Surprisingly, he completed the hand-wiping, strolling to the sofa instead of leaving. Although this outward behavior satisfied Father Hamp, the inner anger remained unexpressed. If the child harbors anger, it’s crucial to allow expression rather than suppressing it. Dad Hamp should strive to maintain consistency in his approach.<br>When a child is angry, attempting to intervene is not behavior modification; real modification is refraining from actions that provoke anger in the first place. Hence, behavior modification always targets parents.<br>If there’s no harm in skipping handwashing upon returning home, leave it be, preventing a cascade of subsequent problematic behaviors. Many behavioral issues arise from enforced actions. The initial imposition generates a sequence of problematic behaviors. By avoiding the initial provocation, subsequent issues may never arise.<br>Forcing a child to engage in undesired activities fosters the child’s “inconsistency in action.” Why do adults compel children? What motivates adults to nurture a child’s “inconsistency in thought and action”?<br>Is handwashing essential? Must it be done every time? If I skip it, will I surely fall ill? What’s the likelihood of getting sick with less washing? Will it lead to severe or minor illness? Often, adults magnify low-probability events, plunging into boundless panic. This amplification of consequences propels children. Why can adults compel children? Because adults wield significant power. The core reason for controlling children is the fear embedded in adults’ hearts. Releasing excessive fear enables both adults and children to live more tranquilly.<br>In Hamp’s childhood, his father frequently enforced handwashing, but gradually, this control lessened. For other activities, like face-washing, letting go poses no harm, and Hamp’s dad isn’t bothered. Presently, Hamp skips washing his face.<br>If skipping handwashing is possible this time, forget it. If it’s imperative, and the child resists, some force might be necessary. Forcibly taking him to wash is strong, met with strong resistance. Using wet paper towels minimizes force, reducing resistance. Employing “minimal force” grants children maximum freedom while addressing the issue. It not only minimizes coercion but also resolves the problem, ensuring satisfaction for both children and parents—a test of parental integration skills.<br>Gentle coercion or positive reinforcement is an option. Washing hands could be tied to fulfilling one of their wishes, fostering a sense of joy and proactive handwashing. However, this still constitutes a form of control, deploying authority over children and creating an uneven dynamic. Therefore, it should be used judiciously and infrequently. Moreover, it might lead to a misconception, with children associating handwashing solely with obtaining rewards, not understanding the correct cause-and-effect relationship—washing hands because they are dirty.<br>To establish the true cause-and-effect relationship, the hands can be wetted, soap applied, and when touched to the white porcelain surface of the basin, black fingerprints appear. This visually demonstrates the rationale for handwashing, enabling the child to perceive the reason and lessening any discomfort.<br>By presenting the authentic cause-and-effect scenario, the child comprehends the purpose behind washing hands, addressing this particular aspect of autism. Whether to wash, or how to do it, becomes the child’s personal challenge, now that the reason is clear.<br>Long-term neglect of handwashing is unrealistic. Some children enjoy playing with water, washing their hands every few days during playtime or when bathing. However, Hamp’s father often assumes his child never washes hands, leading to unnecessary panic.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: if a child goes a whole year without handwashing, scratches, eats without falling sick, and repeats this without consequences, he might continue the behavior. Conversely, if he goes a year without handwashing, falls sick multiple times, and experiences the repercussions, he may wake up to the importance of hand hygiene. This is when genuine knowledge is acquired. Parents should recognize that this process is lengthy and challenging. Children truly grasp cause and effect when they feel it physically; preaching and interference seldom create such awareness.</p>
<p>A child with diverse physical sensations develops a better understanding. Although this process is more extended for autistic children, it establishes a solid foundation. Autistic parents comprehend the nuances of Hamp’s father’s lifestyle. Healthy individuals might overlook health, but the sick truly appreciate it. Deep feelings contribute to a profound understanding. While normal individuals gain deep understanding through personal experiences, without a foundation, preaching falls on deaf ears. With a foundation, children grasp many concepts automatically, rendering preaching unnecessary. Therefore, in various situations, silence is golden—a task for parents.<br>Communication is a tool, and silence is also a mode of communication. For instance, when Hamp threw the egg on the ground, his father, Hamp’s dad, remained silent. Hamp pondered over the silent response, interpreting it as an indication that the exchange had concluded. Communication is about the transmission of meaning, not confined to verbal expression. Many mistakenly perceive communication as solely reliant on spoken words, which is a narrow view.<br>A practical demonstration involves wetting your hands, applying hand sanitizer, rubbing your hands, and then touching the washbasin. Black lines appear on the white porcelain, representing the dirt that has been washed away. After rinsing your hands and touching the washbasin again, the darkness disappears. This process is akin to connecting points into a chain, capturing key moments and stringing them together. Photograph these key points, creating a photo chain. Develop a video from this photo chain, featuring words like “clean,” “dirty,” and “washed.” In essence, capturing moments for educational materials is more impactful than studying methods to interfere with children’s behavior.</p>
