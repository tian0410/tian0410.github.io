The doctor spent 30 minutes with Hamp and diagnosed him with moderate autism. Our family stayed in the Keyuan Hotel opposite the Sixth Hospital. The accommodation there was very cheap and there were no windows in the room. I feel like I am a beggar in this huge city. My college classmates came to see me and chatted with me for a long time, hoping that I would be more open-minded. I don’t have the ability to look away. The pressure of Autistic disease is like a mountain weighing me down so much that I can’t breathe. I never thought that I would encounter disability, but the impossible happened anyway. Eight years later, today is December 3, 2016. My children and I came to Peking University Sixth Hospital again after eight years. However, this time, we are not here to see a doctor, but to attend the Cross-Strait Autism Symposium. In the Yifu Building in the courtyard, my children and I went to have this meeting. Hanpu also has a name tag, and Guo Hanpu’s name is also written on the ticket. He is no longer a spectator, he is also an invitee. Hamp walked straight to his seat and sat down, looking so rude and like a big-name celebrity. Hamp’s father, named Hamp Daddy, also spoke at the meeting for 30 minutes. Hamp made his dad. We stayed in a hotel in the compound, and the conditions were much better than last time. The room has a window. The accommodation fee is also paid by the conference organizer. After the afternoon session ended, while walking with my children along the road outside the hospital compound, I suddenly noticed a small alley across the street. It bore the inscription “Keyuanbin,” with the word “Guan” missing. This sight brought back previous feelings, yet I managed to suppress my surprise. In this sprawling city, even as a newcomer, I felt I could find my place and no longer felt like an outsider.<br>This time, we refrained from entering the outpatient clinic building and instead revisited the hospital’s entrance. At the gate of Peking University Sixth Hospital, I took a photo of Han Pu. Over the past years, Hamp had grown taller, transitioning into a teenager. He had slimmed down, appearing thinner than before, but his facial expression remained as radiant as it was eight years ago. I’ve strived to minimize any secondary trauma Hamp had experienced and preserved the sunny disposition he had back then to the best of my ability. During these eight years, I’ve avoided unnecessary detours and significantly minimized the impact of rigorous, rigid metaphysical training on my child. As a result, the brightness and warmth of his smile haven’t been dimmed by years of training; it remains as sunny and radiant as ever.</p>
<p>Today, I feel an entirely different sense of empowerment, as if I’ve successfully trampled autism under my feet, shattering it to pieces. The overwhelming suffocation I experienced eight years ago due to my son’s autism is no longer present. The inconceivable has transpired. Man is resolute in challenging fate, and the predestined path is not absolute; it’s shaped by human hands.<br>Of the six core areas—emotions, sleep, diet, exercise, comprehension, and expression—my current focus is on controlling diet and exercise. I aim to condition my child’s body for robust health and instill positive living habits. Understanding and expressing aspects related to autism are no longer a concern.<br>This morning, after waking up, I massaged my child’s belly and ensured he drank water in our hotel room. He had a bowel movement, and I observed plant matter in his stool. Lately, I’ve persistently encouraged him to consume a variety of vegetables, and he has been cooperative. Despite feeling nauseated and tearful after eating green vegetables, he managed to consume them. The child has grown more sensible, comprehends my instructions, and is easier for me to care for.<br>In the evening, a few of us parents gathered for a small meal featuring Peking duck. Upon our return, Hamp and I walked back together. As we strolled through the capital’s streets, even though the thoroughfare was quiet, I felt a sense of mastery over the city. Returning to the hotel was smooth, and Hamp made it without difficulty. It seems that the technique of belly massages still works. I also realized that consuming meat leads to constipation.<br>I massaged the child’s belly . Subsequently, he fell asleep, and his breathing became gentle and calm.<br>During the meeting, I presented a report, the main essence of which is summarized below:<br>To aid Hamp in his recovery, I delved into understanding what he possessed and what he lacked. This quest demanded diligence, wisdom, and the refinement of human nature. Eventually, I realized that what I believed he lacked, he actually possessed. Even if he doesn’t have a towering tree, there is a seed within him aspiring towards growth into that towering tree. Did Hamp comprehend fractions before? No. However, he baked a cake, sliced it into four equal parts, then further divided those pieces into eight equal sections. That’s how he grasped the concept: a quarter equals two eighths, one equals four quarters, and one also equals eight eighths.<br>I previously thought that consciousness was the paramount factor, ability occupied the middle ground, and knowledge was at the foundation. Presently, I believe consciousness stands at the apex, repeated three times. From nothingness emerges the unit, and from the unit, all things naturally follow. The origin of the singular unit from nothingness is a fundamental process.<br>The title of my report is “Hamp’s Journey from Life to Books.” Neither life nor books take precedence; what’s vital is the transition from life to books. This concept resonates with the philosophical principles of Wang Yangming. It’s not about the quantity of what you hold within but the fluidity of your channels of expression. Instead of fixating on what the child doesn’t know, focus on what they already comprehend. By recognizing that the child possesses everything, they are no different from typical individuals.<br>I am an advocate for deductive learning. The child already holds a full score of 100 points. By subtracting just one point from him, he could potentially gain another. Hence, the child’s progress relies more on his father’s contribution than on the child himself.<br>There’s also an approach involving additive learning. Initially, I thought the child scored zero, so I taught him to score one, and he responded by giving me a score of one. Regrettably, I couldn’t effectively teach him in this manner.<br>A child can indeed acquire a skill and showcase proficiency, but how did they learn it? If the child explored and learned by themselves, it’s genuine. However, if they were compelled into the process, it remains superficial.<br>Home is where children truly belong. Observing how older children lack a place to go after completing elementary and junior high school, I aim to address the housing issue early on. Home is everything and provides a space for everything to happen.<br>The environment that becomes ingrained in a child’s heart is, undeniably, the environment. I believe I am moving in the right direction, consistently forging ahead. Despite the solitude, I shouldn’t look back; instead, I must continue to take another 10,000 steps forward. The journey is lengthy, and each step signifies progress. Pioneers may face solitude but are entrusted with the responsibilities of their era.<br>Eight years ago, there was a photo of me and my child at Tiananmen Square. The child’s innocent smile sharply contrasted with my somber expression. Reflecting on it now, the world itself isn’t at fault—I was merely troubling myself unnecessarily.<br>After 8 years, I’ve come to realize that what we term “autism” is just a part of normality. The label “autism” is fundamentally a misunderstanding.<br>Consider how many parents and their children still frequent hospitals today. What do they look like? I hope my experiences can alleviate the distress for more parents in similar situations.</p>
