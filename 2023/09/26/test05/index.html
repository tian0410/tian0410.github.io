It takes one and a half hours from Qinshui Community to Taibai Community . Walk from Qinshui Community to Changlepo Subway Station, take the subway for 2 stops to Tonghuamen, change to Line 3 and take 9 stops to Taibai South Road Subway Station. After exiting the station, walk east for about 1 kilometer to Taibai Community. Taibai Community is between Jixiangcun Subway Station and Taibai South Road Subway Station, and is adjacent to Taibai South Road Subway Station. Once or twice, we took the Jixiangcun subway station and walked west for more than 1 kilometer to Taibai Community. One kilometer due north of Jixiangcun Metro Station is my unit inspection bureau. It seems that one time when we were going to Taibai Community from Jixiangcun subway station, when we passed the intersection, I asked Hamp what was to the north? I told him it was the Quarantine Bureau.<br>After arriving at Taibai Community, I chatted with Gu Guo’s mother, Teacher Peng, and several former Xunyu parents, and then I went to work. At noon, I cycled back to Taibai from my workplace, had a meal together, took a lunch break, and then cycled back to my workplace to go to work. It takes 10 minutes to ride to the unit.<br>There was a meeting at work in the afternoon. Just after the meeting, at 16:20 , Teacher Peng sent a WeChat message saying that Hamp was missing. Hamp opened the door at 16 o’clock and left. When Teacher Peng discovered that Hamp was missing, Hamp had been gone for several minutes. Teacher Peng went downstairs to look for Hamp. After searching for more than ten minutes, he still couldn’t find him. Then he sent me a WeChat message to tell me.<br>Hamp was lost, for the first time. In the past few times, I was so anxious that I couldn’t stand up, lost my mind, and was extremely worried. I thought about all the possibilities, and the more I thought about it, the more scared I became. After I heard this this time, I told Teacher Peng that it was okay and I would come look for him. I was very calm. I didn’t pretend to be calm, and I didn’t tell myself to be strong, but I was very, very calm, even calmer than usual. When the child is older, if he cannot take this step, if he cannot walk independently and go home in society, what is the meaning of so many years of rehabilitation education?<br>I thought about it and I thought he took the subway back to Changlepo. I got up and left the unit, took a motorcycle, and went to the Taibai South Road subway station to look for him, but couldn’t find him. I showed Hamp’s photo to the subway entrance security employee and she said she didn’t see him. Hamp is more prominent and easily impresses others.<br>When I turned around and walked out of the subway station, I happened to meet Teacher Peng coming in. Teacher Peng was very anxious, but she said I was very calm. I calmed down and I was able to calm her down. I said it was okay, such a big child was not lost, but simply lost contact.<br>She said she asked the owner of the store in the east gate of the community, but she didn’t see Hamp. We entered Taibai Community together from the north gate and walked back to the studio without seeing Hamp. Teacher Peng continued to search in the community.<br>I rode to the Jixiangcun subway station. When I entered the station, I asked the security employees but they didn’t see Hamp. I showed them Hamp’s photo. I left the subway station and walked towards my workplace. Teacher Fan called me and took the subway to Changlepo. As a result, Chengguo’s mother also went to Changlepo, and so did Li Hua.<br>I was at the intersection of Jixiangcun subway station, and I went into Qiulin Company in the northwest corner. I went in and walked around, found EMI chicken, took a photo, and went to the toilet. I thought to myself that it would be exhausting for us to look for him, so he could only look for us. I believe that children have this ability, and I am willing to give them such opportunities. I walked to my workplace, but I didn’t see Hamp along the way. I returned to the office and sat for a while, drank some water, and then went downstairs. Then I went back and told the guard on duty at my unit that if my son comes, intercept him and call me.<br>Opposite the office building is a good noodle shop. I went in and had a big bowl of handmade noodles, which tasted very authentic, and a bowl of soup. During the meal, Han Ma called me and asked me where to find it, how to find it, should I contact the bus terminal, and so on. I was embarrassed to say I was eating, so I said I was looking. After I was full, I left the noodle shop and went to Taibai Community.<br>My analysis is that if Hamp wanders off, he will return to the studio. Either take the subway home or go to my workplace to find me.Hamp’s mom is at home. It’s been more than two hours, and Hamp hasn’t gotten home yet. He didn’t go to my workplace either. Then just hang out in Taibai Community. There are two passages on the way to Taibai Community. One is to take South Second Ring Road and Yongsong Road, and the other is to take Hanguang Road and Jixiang Road. At the fork in the road, I thought for a moment and decided that I should take the second passage. Because we had never walked through the first passage, and I never told him. I have never walked through the first passage, but I told him about it before.<br>I am analyzing that Hamp has a strong sense of purpose and will not run around. Either go back to Taibai, go back to Qinshui Community, or go to my workplace to find me. He also has the ability to starve to death, and he can strongly demand the boss to give him something to eat. He ate other people’s food without paying , and if someone stopped him and called the police, I would have found him because I had already called 110 and filed a report. As long as he does not touch the bottom line of social norms, it means that he is now walking freely in society and does not cause obstacles to others. This means that he has good rules. If he encounters the bottom line of social norms, he will be found.<br>Besides, people in society are becoming brighter and brighter now, and there are good people everywhere. I believe in this society even more. If he touches the bottom line of social norms, Hamp can still tell his father’s phone number and where he lives without others calling the police. After such an analysis, I felt safe, calm, and surprisingly calm. When I lost contact, I believed in my son. Although we can’t find a phone number or contact us, our hearts are connected under this starry sky. The highest level of the connection between heart express and heart express is the connection between hearts. I can feel the power of faith.<br>Losing contact will become the norm for children. They go out by themselves in the morning and come home at night. This is the norm, and this is the way in and out of society. Social skills require thinking and growing in real society. This kind of loss of contact is a testimony of the child’s ability and is also necessary for the child. It is normal for an autistic child to be able to fully establish himself in society and do things by himself. This is just the beginning, so there is no need to make a fuss. If I make a fuss, it shrinks the child’s space, which is not good for the child’s development.<br>True gold must be refined from fire, and true gold is not afraid of fire. If a child does not have the opportunity to go out early and come home late, can he be considered a member of society? Now that Hamp’s abilities have arrived, my heart is at peace. Hamp’s mother called and said that she was restless and didn’t know what to do. I said that’s because you don’t understand. Just like me, when I was diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis, I fell into panic. Several doctors told me that it was fine and there was nothing to worry about, but I just couldn’t sit still because I didn’t understand. Regarding children and autism, I think I understand, I have feelings, and I have differentiated feelings.<br>Every time I got lost in the past, I didn’t take any photos. How could I bother to take photos? Now my mood is different. I searched all the way to take pictures, catch up on the 10,000 steps to be completed today, and also took the time to eat a bowl of noodles. A colleague bumped into me and asked me what I was doing. I smiled and said that my son was lost and I was looking for him. My colleague looked puzzled. I said it was okay, so I left and kept walking and looking. The department leaders and colleagues were also anxious, but they could definitely see that I was stable and relaxed, and I was smiling all the time.<br>I keep laughing, because this day will come sooner or later. If you want to grow up and enter the society, this kind of thing will come sooner or later. It’s better to come than not to come at all, and it’s better to come early than to come late. I’m laughing in my heart. Once you have security and trust, you should go out into society alone. What is sociality? It’s nothing more than a person leaving early and coming back late.<br>When I left my workplace to finish my noodles and walked 200 meters south, I took a photo with my phone of a store on the roadside that Hamp often paid attention to. At a glance, I saw a figure among the people queuing up in front of Zhengxin Chicken Steak and subconsciously came into view, it was him! He stood in front of the stall and ordered barbecue and chicken steaks, and the boss obeyed and cooked them for him.<br>I took photos. I tapped Hamp on the shoulder and smiled. I smiled and said I have been looking for you for three hours, where have you gone? Hamp was still holding a piece of pineapple in his hand, which he had already eaten half of. The boss handed two skewers of barbecue to him. He also wanted chicken steaks and bought them too. After I paid the money, I asked him where are you going? Hamp looked at me and didn’t answer, because it was hard to answer. why? He originally went to my workplace to look for me, but now that he met me, he stopped going to my work. I asked him where he was going. It was difficult for him to answer. I changed my approach and asked : Are you looking for your father at work? He said yes. I’m still not convinced, I still feel like the communication was not successful. I asked, where is it up there? He said Quarantine(my workplace). It seems that he does know that , which proves that he is really coming to find me.<br>I saw him carrying the backpack I usually carry, and in the backpack were his things that he had packed. He still had his coat draped over one arm. When Teacher Peng returned to the studio, he told us that Hamp had taken the coat away. This proved that Hamp had something in mind and he wanted to take the things home or go to his father. When Hamp was buying barbecue, he stole someone else’s queue. The young man behind him got angry and left without buying. The boss seemed helpless. I explained that there was something different about my child, which confused my boss even more. The boss really couldn’t tell that Hamp was different from normal people, because all the responses were fluent, and the communication when buying things was smooth, natural and firm. Hamp wanted to buy two barbecue skewers and chicken steaks, and he communicated naturally.<br>I posted the Hamp’s photo of queuing up to buy barbecue to the studio group. Hamp’s mom was relieved immediately. We walked a few meters south and came to a tricycle fruit stall, and Hamp said he wanted watermelon. This is where I got the pineapple just now. I gave the boss some extra money, and he was a good person. A person next to me came over and said that the boss was a good person. Yes, there are good people everywhere in society, and this is the basis for children’s recovery.<br>How bold a person is, how productive the land is. For Hamp, that’s exactly what happened. As Hamp’s abilities become higher and higher, the society he faces will inevitably become wider and wider. There is nothing outside the heart. As the heart becomes bigger, there will be more and more things in the heart. I had to find ways to ensure the most basic safety, such as putting a locator watch in my backpack and letting him fly. The kite needs to be flown, and at the same time, the string in your hand cannot be broken.<br>We entered the Jixiangcun subway station and passed the security check channel in front of Hamp. The two little girls at the security check looked at Hamp and murmured to each other in surprise, as if they had discovered something but were not sure. I smiled and said, found him. They are cute and smile brightly. Everyone is paying attention, this is our society.<br>Give your children a chance to go out early and come home late. This opportunity should gradually become normal. This is the real road to recovery. Are many people avoiding this path? Is there a road to recovery other than this? Regardless of recovery, everyone has to enjoy it happily, right?<br>Hamp left the studio at 16:00, and it was 18:30 when we met . It took him 2 and a half hours to walk a little more than 1 kilometer? I walked to my workplace at this speed and I’ll be off from work too! What did he do every moment during these two and a half hours? If there are photos, I would be willing to pay for them! I especially want to see it.<br>When I got back to bed at night, Hamp’s big meal came. He used my phone to type and look for things, look through photos, and take pictures of the boxes of pill boxes he bought. Taking photos, this method really made Hamp more and more aware. The advantage of photos is that they are more convincing than words. If a child who cannot speak can be taught to speak, the words he will say are things that normal people would not say. This is the disadvantage of speaking itself. Photos avoid this drawback.<br>How to promote children? Keep things simple and repetitive, not complicated and empty.<br>Hamp can recite a lot of the language from cartoons without even realizing it! Therefore, PPT must keep up.<br>Hamp can pack up independently and come to see me at work. This opportunity must become a normal thing. Next time, let Teacher Peng tell Hamp to find his father, while I hide and follow him.</p>
