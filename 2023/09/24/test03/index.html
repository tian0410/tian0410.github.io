It turned out that he had not been in my heart and eyes for so many years. It turns out that for so many years, all I had in my mind was an autistic person who couldn’t do anything. Later, this feeling became numb and became subconscious!<br>Now, starting to become stronger, I have him in my eyes. I just realized that I should respect him! I found that I could no longer underestimate him.<br>Let me review my life for the five days from October 15th to October 19th . Life these days has become a normal state.<br>October 15th :<br>This day is Saturday. It’s raining outside and it’s cold. Hamp added a thin coat to himself. In the morning, after our meeting at China Garden, we went to the old place on Wenhua Road to buy big-faced chicken steak. In the past, I usually bought chicken steak, then went to a noodle shop next door, and then went to watch a movie. Because there is a concert at 2pm. I asked Hamp whether to go to a movie or a concert. He chose the concert and we didn’t go to the movie. On the way home that night, he told me to go see a movie tomorrow. Only when I give my children full freedom can they arrange their lives reasonably. You can watch a movie anytime, but there is only one concert. Let’s watch the concert first. This is his choice. So, he told me to watch a movie the next day.<br>Attending concerts, he loved it. Follow the whole process. I don’t know if I understand it or not, but I’m not going out to play anyway. I said let’s go first and stop looking, but he didn’t. In the end, Hamp won the first prize. His seat number was 262, which was lucky. The prize is a 12- hole ocarina.<br>While we were waiting for the bus back home, Hamp took photos of a few of us. We are asked to squat and we are asked to stand. He also took a photo of a couple.<br>October 16 :<br>Woke up early in the morning, Hamp made some medicine and drank it, brushed his teeth, and we went out without breakfast. We took bus 18 to watch a movie at Wenhua Road North Third Ring Station. He knew that bus 16 was for the train station and bus 18 was for going to the movies. bus 16 costs 5 yuan, bus 18 costs 2 yuan. When we can take bus 18 or bus 16 , even if bus 16 comes first, he can still wait for bus 18 . When we arrived at the end, we went to the old place to buy big-faced chicken steak, but the store wasn’t open yet. We arrived at 9:51 and the store will open at 10 o’clock. We left and went to Beijin Building. The building wasn’t open either, so we turned around and went to KFC for breakfast. KFC does not have breakfast after 10 o’clock. It was already past 10 o’clock when we arrived at KFC. After ordering food, Hamp waited with a sign while I went to use the restroom. When I came back, Hamp had already started eating. He can buy movie tickets, select seats, and collect tickets by password. The hibiscus vegetable soup was too hot, so he added ice cubes or mineral water. After watching a movie, we went downstairs to the first floor and passed a shop where we ate. Hamp took several bottles of drinks and opened them all. When leaving, he put the ones with lids on and took the ones without lids. Hamp smiled happily when he saw the funny video on his phone. After returning to school, I rode my bike to buy Guangxi Golden Chuanzi. I was riding a bicycle across the zebra crossing. I felt it was dangerous and I gave him a shout. I guess the noise confused him. I said there was no car and I passed quickly, but he backed away. I found out I was wrong.</p>
<p>After returning to school, we go home. I got a call to pick up a package and Hamp went home alone. When I came back downstairs 30 minutes later, the lights were on. He opened the door for me and put the key on the shoe cabinet at the door. He has gone to bed.<br>October 17 : Monday. Hamp got up earlier than me. He made his own medicine and drank it. I made my own steamed buns with eggs. After school, go to Lu Sanguo for dinner. He ordered four dishes. It was too much for just the two of us, so I suggested he order Kung Pao Chicken. He took pictures of me. What should I do if I can’t eat so much at one time? He told me to eat shredded pork with Beijing sauce tomorrow, spicy tofu the day after tomorrow, and a large plate of chicken the day after tomorrow. When ordering food, he would look for words he didn’t know. Hamp’s handwriting is good and artistic. I went to Dennis to buy some fruits and he said Zhang Dingbang Village.</p>
<p>While taking a shower at night, he repaired the leaking shower head pipe. He did most of the repairs himself, and I did the most critical work.<br>October 18 :<br>Today is tuesday. When I woke up in the morning, there was a power outage and breakfast was not made. We arrived at school. I went to buy breakfast 2 kilometers away, but Hamp didn’t go. I brought him a carton of pure milk. Hamp asked me to go back and get the grapes, and I went home and got them for him. He wants to take away the key again, and he wants to go home and get the rest of the fruit. I told him to hurry up or else he would miss the bus. When he heard this, he came back, gave me the key and asked me to go back and get it. He’s here watching. When passing Grandma Cui, Hamp said little pudding, making everyone laugh.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning thinking about little pudding! Thinking about it, I was like this when I was a child. I especially liked playing billiards. Every morning when I arrived at the host’s house early, he hadn’t gotten up yet. There was a power outage today and I couldn’t steam rice, so grandma in the kitchen made steamed buns. There is electricity in Zhang Dingbang Village, so Teacher Tang and I messaged on WeChat. Hamp could understand. When Hamp came back to my classroom in the afternoon, the first thing he said was money! I took one yuan to buy some pudding. He was still thinking about what was most important to him.<br>After school in the afternoon, he went to Lu Sanguo. He wanted to take a tricycle, but the tricycle was driven away by someone else. He just waited, but couldn’t wait any longer, so he rode away. When ordering, he only wrote down the shredded pork with Beijing sauce and rice he wanted to eat today. I bought Dahongpao, Chili King, and fermented bean curd in the supermarket. I’m homesick and I don’t have any gas anymore. Why buy these?<br>I found out the next day that he was going to take him to Zhang Dingbang Village for cooking. He made fruit salad on the mountain. I don’t know if the teacher told him to buy these things, or if he thought about it himself.<br>Yesterday when I was riding across the street, I gave Hamp a fight. When I crossed the road today, I was far behind. I thought I didn’t care, but from afar I saw Hamp waiting for me. Until I came to him, he was pushing his bicycle and he was walking across the road. It seems that I gave him a good deal of noise, but did not knock him out. He understood, so he did it. He has his own way to solve the problems he encounters. He is proactive. This is the ability that children must develop.<br>In the evening I asked him what he had eaten yesterday, today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. He told me everything in detail.<br>October 19 :</p>
<p>I got up in the morning , picked up his things and went to school. After arriving in the mountains, going to the wild and returning home, he cooked a few dishes. Spicy tofu, fried vegetables with eggs. Teachers at Nature House send photos of children to our Nature House group every day. Children’s education lies in such details, thank you! Hamp’s blowout development this year is partly due to the basis of consistency, and partly due to the conditions for the blowout. He is very close to every teacher here and often talks about them, especially Grandma Zhang. Grandma Zhang went to Beijing for a month, and Han Pu asked how many days she would have. Grandma Zhang came back. She was happy and embarrassed to see Grandma Zhang after seeing her for a long time, standing aside and laughing. Eighteen is a teacher who used to take care of Hamp. He went home to work. Hamp talked about him, and he sent the location and photos for Hamp to see. Hamp could understand.<br>Some thoughts:<br>Miracles are not miracles, miracles are normal things. Because the direction is wrong, normality becomes an impossible miracle in the mind.<br>Traveling across thousands of mountains and rivers, I looked back silently, but that person was there in the dim light. The moment he lowered his head, he discovered the path under his feet. I think the way is to eat, drink, have fun and write books. To put it more loftily, practice brings true knowledge. I would also like to add that practice is free.<br>Many parents are trying to rehabilitate their children while thinking that it is impossible for their children to recover. Discussions among parents in the WeChat group are very lively and intense, and I think this is normal. Since it is normal, the child must enter. It would be great if children could argue as fiercely as we do. However, many parents will say, isn’t that normal? How is that possible? I thought to myself that while we were having a heated exchange of ideas about educating children, what I was thinking in my mind was that autism could never be cured. what are you doing then? Just to make yourself happy?<br>All the photos I take are understandable to children. I believe that one day, Hamp will be able to understand all these articles I have written, and this day is not too far away. I believe that one day, like me, he will start writing his own articles, and that day will be closer.</p>
