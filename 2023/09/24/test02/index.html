What are these expectations?<br>The child is now 8 years old. What are your goals for the child? Everyone has goals, high or low. It is impossible without goals. Goals determine your attitude and methods.<br>I hope there will be no problem in taking care of myself. What is self-care? Knows heat and cold, knows hunger. Children’s patience is greater than ours. When my children’s patience has not reached its limit, I have reached its limit. Children silently endure more than we do. The child really wants to be assertive, but he can’t defeat his mother.<br>Be independent, not dependent on your mother, and know what to do every day. What can I do by myself in the morning? What can I do by myself in the afternoon? I can arrange my daily life by myself and be emotionally stable. The second is to get married, live happily, and regulate the marital relationship. Leave him a house in the future. If I leave my child now, he will be able to dress and cook, but when his mother is around, he will not do it. If the child has some money, he can go out and buy some. Relatives at home can visit him from time to time. The premise is that the child has the ability to work hard on his own. If you are hungry in the morning, you can cook for yourself. When the environment changes, especially in a new environment, children can find the direction without panic and know the direction well.<br>In the morning, I saw Yang Ma off, and Hamp also went. Hamp pushed me to say noodles, meaning to go home and eat noodles. The breakfast at home is noodles. When you let go of your children from an early age, they will have the seeds of their own opinions in the environment. The second is to do better and better. As long as the child’s love for his father does not disturb the child’s heart or expression, the seeds in his heart will sprout and grow.<br>The environment’s acceptance of Hamp. Hamp was not allowed to attend a lecture before, and he was very aggrieved. Hamp educated us, and later we no longer refused him in lectures. Hamp was free in the lecture environment. Later, his behavior did not interfere with us. Later, the child could stand on the podium and we talked about his inner thoughts. Environment plus acceptance of children. After so many years, I have found that acceptance is the foundation. It is still a question of acceptance and the level of the standard line of acceptance.<br>The mentality and methods in the process are limited by the goal or the perception of the results. High goals will lead to better methods and mentality in the process. Low goals will make your approach and mentality worse during the process. The goal has little to do with the child’s current ability. The goal is a feeling that is embedded in the heart.<br>I don’t think it will be a problem for my children to live independently, nor will travel be a problem. It will be no problem to have a job that makes money for them to live on for the rest of their lives. It will also be no problem to get married and take care of the family at home. Under the guidance of this goal, I think there is nothing wrong with the child’s current status. Seize what is essential and don’t get hung up on secondary factors or minutiae. Moreover, under the guidance of this goal, I went more into the deepest part of my heart to change my personality that was difficult to change before.<br>When I went to Yuntai Mountain, my child bought and bought again. I thought it was too much, so I started asking him to eat and buy again and eat and buy again. I was very angry. I couldn’t listen to anything in the heat of the moment. I met the most stubborn person in my personality. part, it’s hard to shake. In fact, the source is that I still don’t treat my child as a normal child. If I always remember my future goals, then I won’t get angry in the moment and will act more rationally. The higher the goal, the more inward the part of your personality that needs to be changed becomes. The easy-to-change parts have been changed, and the rest is the hard part. As long as you have ambitious goals, you can break down hard bones. He knows how much the child eats and drinks, and he knows that it is not what I thought.<br>Once, there was an emotional freeze between the adults. The atmosphere was not right, and the child made faces at Da Cong, hoping that the atmosphere would relax and everyone would be harmonious. The adults laughed later, but the children cried in grievance.<br>Hamp was in the house and everyone was taking a nap. Hamp painted his works on the wall with paint alone. Everyone took photos and recorded them. No one stopped the child. On the contrary, the child’s wanton creation allowed everyone to discover the child’s inner world. This makes everyone happy! We have implemented this educational philosophy in practice.<br>The real solution will come when the solution is no longer possible.<br>Human happiness lies in the spiritual world. In the material world, I don’t know if there is happiness. I think we can only find it in the spiritual world. Material freedom? Spiritual freedom? I think it’s still a matter of spiritual freedom. Most of it lies in the brain.<br>The autistic child was in a disadvantaged situation, and I bullied him. I was very angry, but he had to come over to comfort me, and I rejected him. Why is this? Human weakness is really hard to change. I want to work hard to change this key point in my personality.<br>Children are freer in the environment, and I am more open-minded. Children can obtain good behaviors, emotions, and expressions, but at the same time they may have an impact on others and may be made a fuss about, but this is the objective environment. I try to give my children as much freedom as possible. I should also be able to deal with the environment and others calmly, turn conflicts into friendship, and not be enemies with others, let alone children. This requires me to change the hard points in my personality.<br>I want to protect my child on the dark road to normality in the future. Because he will eventually normalize, why don’t I protect him during this process?<br>My goals for my children: they can stay at home by themselves; they can take care of their own food, drink, and clothes; they can reasonably arrange their own enjoyable life instead of a barren and abnormal life; they can walk independently in the city. In society, if you can reasonably handle your own social scope, you must have a clear mind; you can have a money-making model to survive, and you should create a situation, or even the overall situation; you have a certain breadth and height in the field of knowledge, and you can understand College mathematics, logic, overall planning, and systems science; have your own favorite healthy exercise methods and like to delve into research;  children must establish a positive value system.</p>
