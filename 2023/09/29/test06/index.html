<p>Video 2: Hamp asked me to go to Walmart to buy something for him.</p>
<p>This is a question and answer between Hamp and myself. The medium of communication between Hamp and I includes both verbal and non-verbal. It can be seen that his language is normal and natural. His expressions, eyes, micro-behaviors and other non-verbal expressions are normal and natural. There are no traces of formal training in his verbal or non-verbal language, because I got rid of formal training very early on.<br>Non-verbal means active thinking, and Hamp’s non-verbal is good.<br>Hampu started training when he was three years old and two months old, and he trained for 8 months, mainly imitating movements and imitating speech. Then I discovered the problem! Because no matter what I say, I want the child to think, but he just repeats my words or the last few words of the words, and then he thinks that the task is completed and he can get the reinforcer, and his brain is no longer thinking. .<br>I say something, he says something, and then he gets reinforcement. This is my form training for these 8 months. This instills a form of imitation in the child, which hinders his thinking, because what he thinks is that if he says the same thing as his father, he will solve the problem and get reinforcers, which prevents him from thinking about my words. meaning.<br>It took me two years to get rid of my child’s imitation. At that time, I didn’t have the technology I have now, so I mainly used my mouth to get rid of the imitation, so it took a long time. It took me two years to get him to stop imitating. When he was more than 6 years old, his awareness and habit of imitating speech finally disappeared, his active speaking was activated, and he finally started to use his brain instead of just imitating speech.<br>How to improve children’s communication level?<br>Communication includes both verbal and non-verbal. The emphasis is on non-verbal. Never teach your children questions and answers through your mouth. The words that come out of the mouth are names, and names come from children’s own breakthroughs, not through formal indoctrination to make children memorize routines. Only when children have inner clarity and self-breakthrough of reputation barriers can they have good language.<br>Imitation movement training is useless and harmful because it instills in children the consciousness and habit of imitating other people’s behaviors. As a result, the children lose themselves and their own opinions, and they lose their own active thinking.<br>Imitation training is basically useless and very harmful. What are the benefits of imitation training? I guess it’s just a little bit, so that children can imitate parrots early, because the vocal organs are used or lost. Will the vocal organs degenerate if they are not used for a long time? I guess parents are worried about this. As long as the child speaks, even if it is a parrot, the parents will feel that a stone has fallen in their hearts. But is it too much worry and anxiety? Is the child’s crying and screaming also training the vocal organs? I don’t understand this.<br>Moreover, we can train to speak proactively! You can still say it as early as possible and if it is meaningful, isn’t it the best of both worlds?<br>To sum up, let’s talk about consistent training, that is, whatever I say, you will say whatever. This is basically unnecessary. The purpose of consistent speaking in pictures and consistent speaking in mind is also to speak out words, and to speak meaningful words, which can avoid parroting caused by consistent speaking training.<br>How to make pictures and descriptions consistent? How to be consistent? This is what I’ve been working on.<br>I remember one thing very clearly: that day, Hamp and I met with an old parent and her autistic child, Xiao A. Hamp was about 8 years old at the time, and Xiao A was about 20 years old. Xiao A was holding a cake with wrapping paper in his hand. Hamp snatched it away and ate it. Xiao A didn’t know what to do.<br>Mom said, “Whose thing is this?”<br>Xiao Jia said: “Mine.”<br>Mom said, “What should you do?”<br>Xiao Jia said: “I should snatch it back!”<br>Mom said, “It’s not loud enough!”<br>Xiao Jia made a cheering gesture and raised his voice, but there was obvious weakness in his voice. He said, “I want to get it back!”<br>In this scene, the mother is training her child in formality, and if she is following the formality, it is not as natural as Hamp who has not been trained in formality! After they finished the formality, Hamp also finished the cake, and Hamp stuffed the remaining paper wrapping the cake back into Xiao A’s hand. The scene is over.<br>This thing has always been in my mind. At that time, I felt that form training was worse than no training, because instinct is the most natural and normal. Moreover, Xiao A is mild and Hamp is moderately severe. I think Xiao A is not as normal as Hamp, but I couldn’t come up with a solution at that time. Only now do I understand that it turns out that I have to do good non-verbal stuff.<br>How to do good non-verbal work?<br>Yu’s mom: “Hi Dad, I watched your video lecture. It’s so exciting. Children have needs and things have functions. People without language barriers can understand what they say. However, our children have barriers, so we need to film the children’s initiative. The needs and functions of objects in behavior. When he watched the photos and videos, he just walked the chain and expressed it. Finally, he understood that it is awareness and clarity to make children act in unison. He understood that children’s initiative will come from scratch. Parents’ non-verbal expressions It’s the environment. Children can enter the photo chain video and the channel is open. This is my understanding.<br>“After watching your explanation video, I feel that I have ideas for taking pictures. The child has experience. What is missing is the non-verbal channel. When I take pictures with his initiative, I will understand him better and understand that you need to use non-verbal means. He expressed that the child’s language disorder depends on the parents’ non-verbal expression, so that he can calm down and persist in doing simple things.<br>“When children grow up, they have no initiative anymore. If they are stupid or crazy, blame them. Only by following your example can you understand the children’s obstacles. Parents will do it only after they understand. Sometimes it is hard to let go of children, especially when they are older. It is very difficult for parents. I can’t clearly see whether my children are good or bad. I can see my children living a happy life, so I try my best to see my children live a happy life! I am also happy!<br>“Only when parents practice the difficulties of being mute in life can they understand their children’s obstacles. Video explanations can help parents understand more deeply and do better.”<br>This is Yuma’s understanding of my video explanation. She accurately explained an important method! Parents should improve their non-verbal expression skills. Parents should create a non-verbal expression environment.<br>How to teach question and answer?<br>There are two types of question and answer, open mouth and closed mouth. We are going to do closed mouth question and answer.<br>How to do a Q&amp;A that shuts up?<br>Parents should improve their non-verbal expression skills and create a non-verbal expression environment. Parents have improved their non-verbal expression skills. When they want to convey a meaning to their children, they can make a non-verbal expression tool for this meaning. The children will understand what the parents mean at a glance, and the communication will be successful. Successful communication is conducive to the development of active language.</p>
