<p>Parent does –&gt; Parent says<br>Parent does –&gt; Child says<br>Child does –&gt; Parent says<br>Child does –&gt; Child says<br>Parent says –&gt; Parent does<br>Parent says –&gt; Child does<br>Child says –&gt; Parent does<br>Child says –&gt; Child does<br>The most common one we use is: Parent says –&gt; Child does. This is what is usually called an instruction. Parents should be reminded that the instruction round is limited. Do not use it all the time, otherwise the child will form a dependency on instructions, lack of initiative, and form a misunderstanding of things.</p>
<p>I use these rounds in my daily life. Each round is to establish the thinking of doing and saying the same thing. It is best to teach children the thinking of doing and saying the same thing in a variety of rounds. Only then can children summarize the consistency thinking through these rounds. If the rounds given to children are single or stereotyped, and we do not do this round very well, then the child will form a misunderstanding of things, and thus show a dependence on instructions, lack of initiative to say and do, at this time, parents will say that the child is stereotyped. In fact, the child’s stereotypes are the reaction of our stereotyped teaching methods. There will be active reactions to live stimuli; dead stimuli will kill the reactions.</p>
<p>If children have mastered all of these rounds, then children will naturally pay attention to other people’s affairs. The training of children’s attention is improved through the shaping of thinking, not simply requiring children to look at them to understand. Let children understand people and things, and children will pay attention to people and things. We often do not know how to let children understand people and things, but only require them to pay attention to people and things. This is a manifestation of our lack of knowledge, not a problem with children.</p>
<p>Now, Hamp’s behavioral manifestations of consistency thinking are as follows:</p>
<p>He can read the lyrics of children’s songs by himself.<br>He can point and say the people and things in the children’s songs by himself, and he can also point them out to others.<br>When I come back after going out to buy buns, I ask him what I have in my hand, and he will say buns.<br>He will take the initiative to tell others what to do.<br>When others do and say, he will answer what others are doing when asked.<br>He can understand many of the instructions from others, even if he does not understand them, he knows to find the corresponding “doing” in the current scene.<br>Reminder: What is the goal of doing and saying the same thing with children? It is not just the content of saying and doing in doing and saying; more importantly, saying and doing are “consistent”. This is to open the channel for children. Education of children is more in the channel, not just in the content. Through the content, teach children the channel. After children master the channel, they can learn new content through the channel. This is the ability of induction and deduction.</p>
<p>We often point to something and describe it to the child. This is called pointing and saying. Pointing and saying is a kind of doing and saying. When we point to something, we must analyze and determine which part of the child sees this thing. This is behavior analysis. What did the child see after taking a look? We can only describe what he saw if we know what he saw. For example, if we take a red triangle and point it to the child, and the child looks at it, then what did the child see? Is it the color? Or the shape? Or the material? Only if I know that the child saw the color can I say red. If the child sees the shape, and I say red, then according to the principle of doing and saying the same thing, the child will think that this shape is called red. Seeing and saying the same thing is also a kind of doing and saying.</p>
<p>How to know what the child sees? I taught Hamp to take pictures. Hamp learned to take pictures, and the pictures he took were what he saw and wanted. He took pictures of the wheels of the bus, one complete, one half, one less half, and one more half. According to what he saw, using the channel of doing and saying the same thing, I told him what each of the things he saw was called, and he understood it once.</p>
<p>Here is a more concise translation:</p>
<p>**Doing and saying the same thing refers to the consistency between what we say and what we do. It is an important cognitive skill that can help children learn and grow.</p>
