    <title>Every mother has expectations for her child’s future</title>
    <url>/2023/09/24/test02/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Every mother has expectations for her child’s future. What are these expectations?<br>The child is now 8 years old. What are your goals for the child? Everyone has goals, high or low. It is impossible without goals. Goals determine your attitude and methods.<br>I hope there will be no problem in taking care of myself. What is self-care? Knows heat and cold, knows hunger. Children’s patience is greater than ours. When my children’s patience has not reached its limit, I have reached its limit. Children silently endure more than we do. The child really wants to be assertive, but he can’t defeat his mother.<br>Be independent, not dependent on your mother, and know what to do every day. What can I do by myself in the morning? What can I do by myself in the afternoon? I can arrange my daily life by myself and be emotionally stable. The second is to get married, live happily, and regulate the marital relationship. Leave him a house in the future. If I leave my child now, he will be able to dress and cook, but when his mother is around, he will not do it. If the child has some money, he can go out and buy some. Relatives at home can visit him from time to time. The premise is that the child has the ability to work hard on his own. If you are hungry in the morning, you can cook for yourself. When the environment changes, especially in a new environment, children can find the direction without panic and know the direction well.<br>In the morning, I saw Yang Ma off, and Hamp also went. Hamp pushed me to say noodles, meaning to go home and eat noodles. The breakfast at home is noodles. When you let go of your children from an early age, they will have the seeds of their own opinions in the environment. The second is to do better and better. As long as the child’s love for his father does not disturb the child’s heart or expression, the seeds in his heart will sprout and grow.<br>The environment’s acceptance of Hamp. Hamp was not allowed to attend a lecture before, and he was very aggrieved. Hamp educated us, and later we no longer refused him in lectures. Hamp was free in the lecture environment. Later, his behavior did not interfere with us. Later, the child could stand on the podium and we talked about his inner thoughts. Environment plus acceptance of children. After so many years, I have found that acceptance is the foundation. It is still a question of acceptance and the level of the standard line of acceptance.<br>The mentality and methods in the process are limited by the goal or the perception of the results. High goals will lead to better methods and mentality in the process. Low goals will make your approach and mentality worse during the process. The goal has little to do with the child’s current ability. The goal is a feeling that is embedded in the heart.<br>I don’t think it will be a problem for my children to live independently, nor will travel be a problem. It will be no problem to have a job that makes money for them to live on for the rest of their lives. It will also be no problem to get married and take care of the family at home. Under the guidance of this goal, I think there is nothing wrong with the child’s current status. Seize what is essential and don’t get hung up on secondary factors or minutiae. Moreover, under the guidance of this goal, I went more into the deepest part of my heart to change my personality that was difficult to change before.<br>When I went to Yuntai Mountain, my child bought and bought again. I thought it was too much, so I started asking him to eat and buy again and eat and buy again. I was very angry. I couldn’t listen to anything in the heat of the moment. I met the most stubborn person in my personality. part, it’s hard to shake. In fact, the source is that I still don’t treat my child as a normal child. If I always remember my future goals, then I won’t get angry in the moment and will act more rationally. The higher the goal, the more inward the part of your personality that needs to be changed becomes. The easy-to-change parts have been changed, and the rest is the hard part. As long as you have ambitious goals, you can break down hard bones. He knows how much the child eats and drinks, and he knows that it is not what I thought.<br>Once, there was an emotional freeze between the adults. The atmosphere was not right, and the child made faces at Da Cong, hoping that the atmosphere would relax and everyone would be harmonious. The adults laughed later, but the children cried in grievance.<br>Hamp was in the house and everyone was taking a nap. Hamp painted his works on the wall with paint alone. Everyone took photos and recorded them. No one stopped the child. On the contrary, the child’s wanton creation allowed everyone to discover the child’s inner world. This makes everyone happy! We have implemented this educational philosophy in practice.<br>The real solution will come when the solution is no longer possible.<br>Human happiness lies in the spiritual world. In the material world, I don’t know if there is happiness. I think we can only find it in the spiritual world. Material freedom? Spiritual freedom? I think it’s still a matter of spiritual freedom. Most of it lies in the brain.<br>The autistic child was in a disadvantaged situation, and I bullied him. I was very angry, but he had to come over to comfort me, and I rejected him. Why is this? Human weakness is really hard to change. I want to work hard to change this key point in my personality.<br>Children are freer in the environment, and I am more open-minded. Children can obtain good behaviors, emotions, and expressions, but at the same time they may have an impact on others and may be made a fuss about, but this is the objective environment. I try to give my children as much freedom as possible. I should also be able to deal with the environment and others calmly, turn conflicts into friendship, and not be enemies with others, let alone children. This requires me to change the hard points in my personality.<br>I want to protect my child on the dark road to normality in the future. Because he will eventually normalize, why don’t I protect him during this process?<br>My goals for my children: they can stay at home by themselves; they can take care of their own food, drink, and clothes; they can reasonably arrange their own enjoyable life instead of a barren and abnormal life; they can walk independently in the city. In society, if you can reasonably handle your own social scope, you must have a clear mind; you can have a money-making model to survive, and you should create a situation, or even the overall situation; you have a certain breadth and height in the field of knowledge, and you can understand College mathematics, logic, overall planning, and systems science; have your own favorite healthy exercise methods and like to delve into research;  children must establish a positive value system.</p>

    <title>The normalization of Hamp has been obvious</title>
    <url>/2023/09/24/test03/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I really started to respect him and treat him as a normal boy. It turned out that he had not been in my heart and eyes for so many years. It turns out that for so many years, all I had in my mind was an autistic person who couldn’t do anything. Later, this feeling became numb and became subconscious!<br>Now, starting to become stronger, I have him in my eyes. I just realized that I should respect him! I found that I could no longer underestimate him.<br>Let me review my life for the five days from October 15th to October 19th . Life these days has become a normal state.<br>October 15th :<br>This day is Saturday. It’s raining outside and it’s cold. Hamp added a thin coat to himself. In the morning, after our meeting at China Garden, we went to the old place on Wenhua Road to buy big-faced chicken steak. In the past, I usually bought chicken steak, then went to a noodle shop next door, and then went to watch a movie. Because there is a concert at 2pm. I asked Hamp whether to go to a movie or a concert. He chose the concert and we didn’t go to the movie. On the way home that night, he told me to go see a movie tomorrow. Only when I give my children full freedom can they arrange their lives reasonably. You can watch a movie anytime, but there is only one concert. Let’s watch the concert first. This is his choice. So, he told me to watch a movie the next day.<br>Attending concerts, he loved it. Follow the whole process. I don’t know if I understand it or not, but I’m not going out to play anyway. I said let’s go first and stop looking, but he didn’t. In the end, Hamp won the first prize. His seat number was 262, which was lucky. The prize is a 12- hole ocarina.<br>While we were waiting for the bus back home, Hamp took photos of a few of us. We are asked to squat and we are asked to stand. He also took a photo of a couple.<br>October 16 :<br>Woke up early in the morning, Hamp made some medicine and drank it, brushed his teeth, and we went out without breakfast. We took bus 18 to watch a movie at Wenhua Road North Third Ring Station. He knew that bus 16 was for the train station and bus 18 was for going to the movies. bus 16 costs 5 yuan, bus 18 costs 2 yuan. When we can take bus 18 or bus 16 , even if bus 16 comes first, he can still wait for bus 18 . When we arrived at the end, we went to the old place to buy big-faced chicken steak, but the store wasn’t open yet. We arrived at 9:51 and the store will open at 10 o’clock. We left and went to Beijin Building. The building wasn’t open either, so we turned around and went to KFC for breakfast. KFC does not have breakfast after 10 o’clock. It was already past 10 o’clock when we arrived at KFC. After ordering food, Hamp waited with a sign while I went to use the restroom. When I came back, Hamp had already started eating. He can buy movie tickets, select seats, and collect tickets by password. The hibiscus vegetable soup was too hot, so he added ice cubes or mineral water. After watching a movie, we went downstairs to the first floor and passed a shop where we ate. Hamp took several bottles of drinks and opened them all. When leaving, he put the ones with lids on and took the ones without lids. Hamp smiled happily when he saw the funny video on his phone. After returning to school, I rode my bike to buy Guangxi Golden Chuanzi. I was riding a bicycle across the zebra crossing. I felt it was dangerous and I gave him a shout. I guess the noise confused him. I said there was no car and I passed quickly, but he backed away. I found out I was wrong.</p>
<p>After returning to school, we go home. I got a call to pick up a package and Hamp went home alone. When I came back downstairs 30 minutes later, the lights were on. He opened the door for me and put the key on the shoe cabinet at the door. He has gone to bed.<br>October 17 : Monday. Hamp got up earlier than me. He made his own medicine and drank it. I made my own steamed buns with eggs. After school, go to Lu Sanguo for dinner. He ordered four dishes. It was too much for just the two of us, so I suggested he order Kung Pao Chicken. He took pictures of me. What should I do if I can’t eat so much at one time? He told me to eat shredded pork with Beijing sauce tomorrow, spicy tofu the day after tomorrow, and a large plate of chicken the day after tomorrow. When ordering food, he would look for words he didn’t know. Hamp’s handwriting is good and artistic. I went to Dennis to buy some fruits and he said Zhang Dingbang Village.</p>
<p>While taking a shower at night, he repaired the leaking shower head pipe. He did most of the repairs himself, and I did the most critical work.<br>October 18 :<br>Today is tuesday. When I woke up in the morning, there was a power outage and breakfast was not made. We arrived at school. I went to buy breakfast 2 kilometers away, but Hamp didn’t go. I brought him a carton of pure milk. Hamp asked me to go back and get the grapes, and I went home and got them for him. He wants to take away the key again, and he wants to go home and get the rest of the fruit. I told him to hurry up or else he would miss the bus. When he heard this, he came back, gave me the key and asked me to go back and get it. He’s here watching. When passing Grandma Cui, Hamp said little pudding, making everyone laugh.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning thinking about little pudding! Thinking about it, I was like this when I was a child. I especially liked playing billiards. Every morning when I arrived at the host’s house early, he hadn’t gotten up yet. There was a power outage today and I couldn’t steam rice, so grandma in the kitchen made steamed buns. There is electricity in Zhang Dingbang Village, so Teacher Tang and I messaged on WeChat. Hamp could understand. When Hamp came back to my classroom in the afternoon, the first thing he said was money! I took one yuan to buy some pudding. He was still thinking about what was most important to him.<br>After school in the afternoon, he went to Lu Sanguo. He wanted to take a tricycle, but the tricycle was driven away by someone else. He just waited, but couldn’t wait any longer, so he rode away. When ordering, he only wrote down the shredded pork with Beijing sauce and rice he wanted to eat today. I bought Dahongpao, Chili King, and fermented bean curd in the supermarket. I’m homesick and I don’t have any gas anymore. Why buy these?<br>I found out the next day that he was going to take him to Zhang Dingbang Village for cooking. He made fruit salad on the mountain. I don’t know if the teacher told him to buy these things, or if he thought about it himself.<br>Yesterday when I was riding across the street, I gave Hamp a fight. When I crossed the road today, I was far behind. I thought I didn’t care, but from afar I saw Hamp waiting for me. Until I came to him, he was pushing his bicycle and he was walking across the road. It seems that I gave him a good deal of noise, but did not knock him out. He understood, so he did it. He has his own way to solve the problems he encounters. He is proactive. This is the ability that children must develop.<br>In the evening I asked him what he had eaten yesterday, today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. He told me everything in detail.<br>October 19 :</p>
<p>I got up in the morning , picked up his things and went to school. After arriving in the mountains, going to the wild and returning home, he cooked a few dishes. Spicy tofu, fried vegetables with eggs. Teachers at Nature House send photos of children to our Nature House group every day. Children’s education lies in such details, thank you! Hamp’s blowout development this year is partly due to the basis of consistency, and partly due to the conditions for the blowout. He is very close to every teacher here and often talks about them, especially Grandma Zhang. Grandma Zhang went to Beijing for a month, and Han Pu asked how many days she would have. Grandma Zhang came back. She was happy and embarrassed to see Grandma Zhang after seeing her for a long time, standing aside and laughing. Eighteen is a teacher who used to take care of Hamp. He went home to work. Hamp talked about him, and he sent the location and photos for Hamp to see. Hamp could understand.<br>Some thoughts:<br>Miracles are not miracles, miracles are normal things. Because the direction is wrong, normality becomes an impossible miracle in the mind.<br>Traveling across thousands of mountains and rivers, I looked back silently, but that person was there in the dim light. The moment he lowered his head, he discovered the path under his feet. I think the way is to eat, drink, have fun and write books. To put it more loftily, practice brings true knowledge. I would also like to add that practice is free.<br>Many parents are trying to rehabilitate their children while thinking that it is impossible for their children to recover. Discussions among parents in the WeChat group are very lively and intense, and I think this is normal. Since it is normal, the child must enter. It would be great if children could argue as fiercely as we do. However, many parents will say, isn’t that normal? How is that possible? I thought to myself that while we were having a heated exchange of ideas about educating children, what I was thinking in my mind was that autism could never be cured. what are you doing then? Just to make yourself happy?<br>All the photos I take are understandable to children. I believe that one day, Hamp will be able to understand all these articles I have written, and this day is not too far away. I believe that one day, like me, he will start writing his own articles, and that day will be closer.</p>

    <title>I met Liu Mengyuan, and I saw Hamp’s future</title>
    <url>/2022/02/07/trans/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A few pieces of pineapple cake were scattered on a desk in someone’s house in a certain community in a certain province, a certain city. It flew from Taiwan to Zhengzhou, and then took the high-speed train from Zhengzhou to someone’s home in Xi’an. I ate a piece, crispy on the outside and pear on the inside. I couldn’t help but eat another piece. I said I would stop eating after the last piece, and I ate the third piece. I simply agreed and ate two more pieces. My belly is also satisfied and satisfied. I need to be willful and satisfied. (In this paragraph, there are dots, chains, and trees, as well as “needs–active actions–satisfaction”, and the willfulness of doing things in unison.)<br>There is a girl who is seventeen years old and slim. She is from Taiwan. Her name is Liu Mengyuan. Mengyuan is an autistic child. Mengyuan’s mother, Ms. Chen Lan, flew with Mengyuan from Taiwan to Zhengzhou. In Kunda, I met their mother and daughter. Although our gathering lasted only two days, it gave me thoughts from ancient times. From this, I saw the infinite possibilities of this child Hamp in the future. I can imagine any limit, no limit. From this, I thought about the infinite possibilities for the future of autistic children in the world. I can imagine any way I want without any limit.<br>Pineapple cake is a gift given to me by Ms. Chen Lan. Most people call Ms. Chen Lan Teacher Chen, but I call her Mr. Chen Lan from the bottom of my heart. She is 53 years old and has been raising an autistic girl alone for 17 years. When Mengyuan was eight months old, her father passed away due to illness, and her mother raised the child alone. Seventeen years later, a daughter of the Liu family has now grown up. She is tall and graceful, has a quick mind, is handsome, and has sharp teeth. Wherever she goes, there is laughter and laughter, which is really endearing.<br>When Xiao Mengyuan was seven years old, she unfortunately contracted cancer. In the hospital, when the doctor told her that she could only live for three months, she sat on the ground without moving for half an hour. How she drove home later, she still can’t remember. During chemotherapy, she was lying on the hospital bed, looking for a place where she could entrust her dream.<br>How did a mother with cancer get through the past ten years with an autistic child? I can’t imagine. Yesterday, she told me that the tumor is still in her body, and that she and the tumor are good friends, they don’t bother each other and they forget each other. Her spirit permeates the universe, and her life span is equal to that of heaven. It is inconvenient for her to take care of herself now, but she drags such a body and travels to hundreds of lectures a year, which makes me awe and admire her, even though she looks only a little over 1.5 meters to me.<br>Her different life gave me different thoughts. If I use the word “success” to summarize it, I think this word is too frivolous. Mengyuan is not only ordinary, but also better than ordinary. She has rigorous thinking, clear expression and clear character. She has great music and she is our piano princess. She has held solo concerts many times.<br>When Mengyuan was three or four years old, she was watching a concert. She climbed onto the stage to play and was kicked off by the staff. Many people will think, in such a place, if an autistic child does not follow the rules, how will she integrate into society in the future? So you need to modify her behavior!<br>The last time Mengyuan held a solo concert, a three- or four-year-old child climbed onto the stage to play. When the staff wanted to kick the child off the stage, Mengyuan said don’t kick him out. He would be the next person to hold a solo concert.<br>Mengyuan said that she attended 33 kindergartens when she was a child, and was dropped out of school in the shortest two days. I asked her why you were dismissed? She said it was because they were ignorant. The principal of the 33rd kindergarten is the first invitee to the Mengyuan Concert. Although Mengyuan could not speak at the time, the first invitee to her first concert many years later was the principal of the 33rd kindergarten.<br>Mengyuan said to her mother that you always live for others, when will you live for yourself? When will you live a day for me? She advised her mother not to be so tired or worry so much. I told Mengyuan that my mother had lost herself for decades. My mother said that Mengyuan found herself when she was in the third grade of junior high school. I think that a person’s life is to find his inner self and return to his warm hometown. I think everyone is on their way back to themselves. For an autistic child, she had already achieved that.<br>Mengyuan summarized interpersonal relationships. She told her mother that there are four steps: the first time you are good to others, others are grateful; the second time you are good to others, don’t say thank you; the third time you forget to be good to others , others think you owe them; the fourth time you treat others badly, others will scold you. She told her mother to live for herself and not worry too much about other people’s affairs.<br>Some people say this doesn’t look like an autistic child. This is simply a normal person. Yes, I see that there is nothing abnormal about her now, and she has an excellent character that is extraordinary for ordinary people.<br>This time she came out to give a lecture and asked for leave from the school director. The school director disagreed and said that if she asks for leave again, she will exceed the allowed number of days and will expel you according to school regulations. Meng Yuan said that I went out to give lectures for public welfare and to do good deeds, not to make money. You have no right to expel me. You talk about the school rules, I talk about the law.<br>People are normal. Human hearts are normal. Mengyuan said that although she could not speak before she was six years old, her perception was normal. I have always believed that the hearts of autistic children are the same as those of ordinary children and are normal. It’s just that autistic children can’t think alike! Failure to get through the conflict early will cause harm to the child as he or she grows up.<br>Nana is a miniature girl. When Meng Yuan saw Nana for the first time, she exclaimed in unison, “Why are you so tall?” Then Meng Yuan came back to her senses and said, “You are different from me. Everyone is different.” They are different, everyone is unique, and uniqueness is excellence.” Yesterday, I saw them hugging each other, they were in love, and chatting happily.<br>Last night I returned to Xi’an from Zhengzhou, my third trip back from Kangda. Up to now, 24 hours and 15 minutes have passed. What I saw in Kangda has always been in front of my eyes, and what I heard has been lingering in my ears.<br>I met Mr. Wang Huan, a national first-class actor in Henan Opera. He is 75 years old this year. He is full of energy and looks like he is in his early 60s. He sang two pieces of Henan Opera for our meeting, and we went to dinner together. A dining table and several people are my role models.<br>The old man is a moral model. He has adopted seven orphans for 17 years, and some of the children have graduated from college at the age of 22. He funded an ALS patient in Xi’an with 250,000 yuan. In order to feed these orphans, he worked overtime and went to teahouses to earn extra money in addition to his normal performances, because he had 7 orphans to feed in his family. The main patient, who was injured at work due to long-term stress, had a heart problem and later underwent major heart surgery. The old man is awe-inspiring. I’m thinking that one day, I’ll also lead a team of autistic kids.<br>Sister Li Zhiping is in her fifties this year. She is one of the top ten outstanding mothers who moved China, an outstanding volunteer, a national model for learning from Lei Feng, etc. She gave me a business card that said “Serve the People.” Serving the people is also my life value. Pay tribute to Sister Li, she interpreted these five words.<br>Teacher Mou from Kangda Institution who often picks me up and drops me off is also a good person in my heart. He is the father of an autistic child who is not his biological child.<br>In addition to Teacher Chen Lan, I also admire Sister Zhang, the founder of Kangda. Having been engaged in the cause of autism for decades, Kangda has developed very well to what it is today. But at the age of fifty-three, she is still reading WeChat articles from unknown people like me. She has been determined to reform and move forward. If I didn’t have an autistic child, and if I was over 50 years old, would I work as hard as she does? I think this is the gap between me and her, and it is also the gap that I sincerely admire.<br>She said that an institution without an institution is the best institution, a teacher without a teacher is the best teacher, and training without training is the best training. This has been her goal for many years. Now she saw it in my WeChat article, and what I said was from her heart.<br>She invited me, Teacher Chen Lan, and Mengyuan to write a series of books called “Family Organization”. She said that she wrote from the perspective of reflection, I wrote from the perspective of heart-drawing pictures, Teacher Chen wrote from the perspective of natural guidance, and Meng Yuan wrote from the perspective of her growing up as an autistic child. It is also equipped with a set of CD-ROMs that explain the practical operation of the organization. She asked me to be the president of China Autism Network to give full play to my professional advantages.<br>Sister Zhang is a person who denies herself and constantly strives to move forward. I learn from her from the bottom of my heart.<br>I would also like to thank Teacher Chu and Teacher Yan for their help. Otherwise, how could I have met these role models? I’ve said before that channel is more important than content, and it’s really true. They are achieving others without reservation. pay tribute!<br>This “Family Organization” seminar and training session organized by Kangda was attended by many parents and was broadcast live on the China Autism Network.<br>I spoke for two hours and reviewed the shortcomings of many current practices. Most of the things such as imitation, imitation, counting, teaching shapes and colors, teaching classification, teaching rules, behavior modification, etc. can not be done, and it is harmful if done. I put forward a point - knowledge is poisonous. Teach carefully!<br>I talked about the consistency of heart and action, how to reveal the heart through action, and how to understand the knowledge in children’s hearts through action. Do children have colors in their hearts? Is there any addition or subtraction? This is what the heart is shown by doing. My method proves that the child has it in his heart. Doing is a looking glass, seeing all the knowledge points in the child’s heart.<br>Mengyuan talked about his own growth process and some opinions, which are highly consistent with my ideas and can be said to be seamless. An autistic child proves that the theory I summarized is correct, which will cheer up many parents who see me and Mengyuan speaking on the same stage. Some parents told me that a stone has finally fallen to the ground and they firmly followed me.<br>Mengyuan was drinking water on the bed in the hotel room, and her mother was worried that she would tip the cup and spill the water on the bed. Sure enough, it was spilled on the bed, and my mother said, “It’s okay, just ask the waiter to change it.” This sentence was something Mengyuan taught her mother before. In the past, my mother might talk about Meng Yuan emotionally. Meng Yuan told her mother that she should say: “It’s okay, just ask the waiter to change it.” Meng Yuan said that her mother was an expert who was educated by her. Mom said I raised your child.<br>Mengyuan said that he also asked me to play the piano. If you tell me to play the piano, otherwise I will punish you! This makes her very uncomfortable and disgusts her. If you tell me you are a piano princess, can you play a song for us? I feel very comfortable listening to it and I would be willing to do it. Mengyuan is teaching educators how to speak with positive energy. Mengyuan herself is full of positive energy and is a kind-hearted and sunny girl.<br>Mengyuan said there is a glass of water on the table. If I am thirsty, I will drink it. I don’t need you to order me to drink water. If you give me instructions to drink water, my arms will be stiff when I pick up the water. This verifies the correctness of what I said about the consistency of the mind’s actions. Only the actions of the mind that are consistent are natural, and those that are inconsistent with the mind’s actions are rigid.<br>Meng Yuan said there was still time to go to the toilet. I didn’t need to pee, but you forced me to go, and I had to go. My steps to go to the toilet were stiff. Actually, I think what she meant was don’t force me. I advocate exploring thinking in proactive behavior to achieve consensus. This idea is correct. There is no knowledge in passive behavior, which can only cause children to have problematic behaviors that strive for initiative.<br>Meng Yuan said that I drank water on the bed and sprinkled the water on the bed. I will know what to do next time and you don’t need to tell me.<br>Mom said that once Mengyuan took her mother’s car and drove on the highway for two hours, it was troublesome to go to the bathroom in the middle, so she told Mengyuan to go to the bathroom before getting on the highway, but Mengyuan didn’t want to go.<br>Mengyuan said that I have experienced it this time, and I will know what to do next time. You can also use the restroom on the highway. Isn’t there a service area? What Mengyuan said is exactly what I want. Otherwise, how would the children experience the function of using the toilet in the service area?<br>If you don’t give me a chance to practice this time, but give me rules in advance to abide by, it will be to avoid the trouble it will cause you, and at the same time, it will deprive me of my right to practice and the opportunity to experience growth in practice. This is exactly the kind of rules and behavior modification I am against.<br>The so-called behavior modification or rules are nothing more than parents who are afraid of trouble and ask their children in advance what to do or follow the so-called rules, thereby avoiding the trouble that may cause parents. Doing so deprives children of the opportunity to learn and grow in practice. It is true that learning is an upward spiral process. What is learning without spirals?<br>Behavior modification should be a learning process, not a game of interests. Give the learning process back to the children, this is my advice.<br>I remember driving Hamp to and from the institution when he was five or six years old. He was sitting in the back seat. I was driving on the road in Xi’an and Hamp was anxious to pee. What should I do? As long as we are of the same mind, a living person can still die of urination! Hamp peed directly on the ground in the back seat of the car.<br>The same thing happens all the time. Because I always forget to let him go to the toilet to pee when I go out.<br>One time, when Hamp needed to pee, I reached behind and rolled down the window. Of course, I couldn’t roll it down too much, otherwise what would I do if the baby fell out? A gap was exposed, and Hamp saw that he aimed his penis at the gap to pee outside, but he was not tall enough. Why does a rabbit bite when it’s anxious? Hamp became anxious. He immediately stood on the back seat and stood on tiptoe to urinate. I drove slowly because I was afraid of dropping him. I drove slowly, and there was a motorcade blocked behind me. The horns blaring one after another urging me were spectacular! I thought to myself, what’s so exciting about an autistic child peeing.<br>As things went on like this, Hamp learned to use a pulsating bottle to urinate into, and also learned to use a plastic bag to urinate into. He had to carry a plastic bag of urine because it would spill as soon as he put it away. So he learned to tie plastic bags. Tying plastic bags is a proactive behavior, and proactive behavior occurs because of needs and functions. This is learning methods based on needs and functions.<br>I couldn’t take photos of these scenes, but Hamp had seen so many photos that he could describe the scenes without photos. I asked him how many ways to pee in the car? Hamp said pulsing, Ziploc bags, windows, the ground.<br>The spiral in practice, this is the principle of learning. If we don’t do this, without learning, what will the children learn? Therefore, many children who undergo behavior modification live in passivity. When they lose initiative, they lose their souls, their thinking, their learning, and their growth. The more they are corrected, the worse the child becomes. Because correction means not letting children learn.<br>Spiral learning is something that can be found in books and is also spoken by Meng Yuan himself.<br>Don’t push me or I’ll go crazy.<br>Let me go, I know how.<br>Let me go and I will make progress on my own. Your behavior modification will not make me better, it will only make me crazier.<br>These three sentences should be remembered. In fact, this is what the principle of consistency in mind must be observed. People, those who can be themselves are happy people.<br>If you do it with consistency, you will gradually get better. This is behavior modification. I still hate the word correction.<br>Behavior modification and natural guidance are two realms, and my method is to naturally not guide. I am more extreme and more inaction. Under my ideas and methods, Hamp’s progress is increasing day by day.<br>Hamp was going out today, and I followed him. He went to the Dicos store on North Street and bought four kinds of chicken, and then went to the Burger King store for a burger. He wanted to eat two, and he wanted to eat mine too, but I wouldn’t let him eat, so he traded hamburgers with me. Why did he do it so proactively? He is of the same mind. By doing this, I sensed that what he was paying attention to was the taste and size. That’s what made the difference between the two of our burgers.<br>Some parents asked me, can I instill knowledge in their children? I said no! It means that it is not allowed for children in the basic stage. The child has all the knowledge in his heart, he just needs to express it.<br>How to express it using do? You have to think about it. For example, do children have addition and subtraction in mind? You can put three candies he likes in your pocket, take out one for him, and he won’t leave; take out another two for him, and he won’t leave. It shows that he knows the concepts of 3, 1, and 2 in his heart, because he does it in a consistent manner. Use your thoughts to stimulate the child’s mind, and the child will take the initiative to act. This is observing the mind through doing.<br>You indoctrinate your children from the outside in, which is harmful. You just want to teach your children some knowledge.<br>I lead the child from the inside out, and the child learns everything. Living independently is not a big deal, shopping is not a big deal, talking is not a big deal, and social independence is not a big deal. The sky for children’s future is big and blue, and they can be imagined without limit.<br>There are so many behavioral chains in children’s minds that making money to support the family is no longer a big deal.<br>Entertainment, life and work, for children, at least for Hamp, these three areas can reach the level of ordinary people. This is entirely possible in the near future.<br>Some people say how could Mengyuan be autistic? Was it a mistake? Do you see anything unusual about what she said or did? Look how rigorous her thinking is! As rigorous as a programmer.<br>I want to say that today’s dream is tomorrow’s Hanpu.<br>Meng Yuan wants to write a book. She wants to write about her growth, and I can comment on it. We jointly published a book.</p>

    <title>When the child goes missing</title>
    <url>/2023/09/26/test05/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I got up at around 6 o’clock this morning, had dinner, and left Qinshui Community with Hamp to go to the studio in Taibai Community. It takes one and a half hours from Qinshui Community to Taibai Community . Walk from Qinshui Community to Changlepo Subway Station, take the subway for 2 stops to Tonghuamen, change to Line 3 and take 9 stops to Taibai South Road Subway Station. After exiting the station, walk east for about 1 kilometer to Taibai Community. Taibai Community is between Jixiangcun Subway Station and Taibai South Road Subway Station, and is adjacent to Taibai South Road Subway Station. Once or twice, we took the Jixiangcun subway station and walked west for more than 1 kilometer to Taibai Community. One kilometer due north of Jixiangcun Metro Station is my unit inspection bureau. It seems that one time when we were going to Taibai Community from Jixiangcun subway station, when we passed the intersection, I asked Hamp what was to the north? I told him it was the Quarantine Bureau.<br>After arriving at Taibai Community, I chatted with Gu Guo’s mother, Teacher Peng, and several former Xunyu parents, and then I went to work. At noon, I cycled back to Taibai from my workplace, had a meal together, took a lunch break, and then cycled back to my workplace to go to work. It takes 10 minutes to ride to the unit.<br>There was a meeting at work in the afternoon. Just after the meeting, at 16:20 , Teacher Peng sent a WeChat message saying that Hamp was missing. Hamp opened the door at 16 o’clock and left. When Teacher Peng discovered that Hamp was missing, Hamp had been gone for several minutes. Teacher Peng went downstairs to look for Hamp. After searching for more than ten minutes, he still couldn’t find him. Then he sent me a WeChat message to tell me.<br>Hamp was lost, for the first time. In the past few times, I was so anxious that I couldn’t stand up, lost my mind, and was extremely worried. I thought about all the possibilities, and the more I thought about it, the more scared I became. After I heard this this time, I told Teacher Peng that it was okay and I would come look for him. I was very calm. I didn’t pretend to be calm, and I didn’t tell myself to be strong, but I was very, very calm, even calmer than usual. When the child is older, if he cannot take this step, if he cannot walk independently and go home in society, what is the meaning of so many years of rehabilitation education?<br>I thought about it and I thought he took the subway back to Changlepo. I got up and left the unit, took a motorcycle, and went to the Taibai South Road subway station to look for him, but couldn’t find him. I showed Hamp’s photo to the subway entrance security employee and she said she didn’t see him. Hamp is more prominent and easily impresses others.<br>When I turned around and walked out of the subway station, I happened to meet Teacher Peng coming in. Teacher Peng was very anxious, but she said I was very calm. I calmed down and I was able to calm her down. I said it was okay, such a big child was not lost, but simply lost contact.<br>She said she asked the owner of the store in the east gate of the community, but she didn’t see Hamp. We entered Taibai Community together from the north gate and walked back to the studio without seeing Hamp. Teacher Peng continued to search in the community.<br>I rode to the Jixiangcun subway station. When I entered the station, I asked the security employees but they didn’t see Hamp. I showed them Hamp’s photo. I left the subway station and walked towards my workplace. Teacher Fan called me and took the subway to Changlepo. As a result, Chengguo’s mother also went to Changlepo, and so did Li Hua.<br>I was at the intersection of Jixiangcun subway station, and I went into Qiulin Company in the northwest corner. I went in and walked around, found EMI chicken, took a photo, and went to the toilet. I thought to myself that it would be exhausting for us to look for him, so he could only look for us. I believe that children have this ability, and I am willing to give them such opportunities. I walked to my workplace, but I didn’t see Hamp along the way. I returned to the office and sat for a while, drank some water, and then went downstairs. Then I went back and told the guard on duty at my unit that if my son comes, intercept him and call me.<br>Opposite the office building is a good noodle shop. I went in and had a big bowl of handmade noodles, which tasted very authentic, and a bowl of soup. During the meal, Han Ma called me and asked me where to find it, how to find it, should I contact the bus terminal, and so on. I was embarrassed to say I was eating, so I said I was looking. After I was full, I left the noodle shop and went to Taibai Community.<br>My analysis is that if Hamp wanders off, he will return to the studio. Either take the subway home or go to my workplace to find me.Hamp’s mom is at home. It’s been more than two hours, and Hamp hasn’t gotten home yet. He didn’t go to my workplace either. Then just hang out in Taibai Community. There are two passages on the way to Taibai Community. One is to take South Second Ring Road and Yongsong Road, and the other is to take Hanguang Road and Jixiang Road. At the fork in the road, I thought for a moment and decided that I should take the second passage. Because we had never walked through the first passage, and I never told him. I have never walked through the first passage, but I told him about it before.<br>I am analyzing that Hamp has a strong sense of purpose and will not run around. Either go back to Taibai, go back to Qinshui Community, or go to my workplace to find me. He also has the ability to starve to death, and he can strongly demand the boss to give him something to eat. He ate other people’s food without paying , and if someone stopped him and called the police, I would have found him because I had already called 110 and filed a report. As long as he does not touch the bottom line of social norms, it means that he is now walking freely in society and does not cause obstacles to others. This means that he has good rules. If he encounters the bottom line of social norms, he will be found.<br>Besides, people in society are becoming brighter and brighter now, and there are good people everywhere. I believe in this society even more. If he touches the bottom line of social norms, Hamp can still tell his father’s phone number and where he lives without others calling the police. After such an analysis, I felt safe, calm, and surprisingly calm. When I lost contact, I believed in my son. Although we can’t find a phone number or contact us, our hearts are connected under this starry sky. The highest level of the connection between heart express and heart express is the connection between hearts. I can feel the power of faith.<br>Losing contact will become the norm for children. They go out by themselves in the morning and come home at night. This is the norm, and this is the way in and out of society. Social skills require thinking and growing in real society. This kind of loss of contact is a testimony of the child’s ability and is also necessary for the child. It is normal for an autistic child to be able to fully establish himself in society and do things by himself. This is just the beginning, so there is no need to make a fuss. If I make a fuss, it shrinks the child’s space, which is not good for the child’s development.<br>True gold must be refined from fire, and true gold is not afraid of fire. If a child does not have the opportunity to go out early and come home late, can he be considered a member of society? Now that Hamp’s abilities have arrived, my heart is at peace. Hamp’s mother called and said that she was restless and didn’t know what to do. I said that’s because you don’t understand. Just like me, when I was diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis, I fell into panic. Several doctors told me that it was fine and there was nothing to worry about, but I just couldn’t sit still because I didn’t understand. Regarding children and autism, I think I understand, I have feelings, and I have differentiated feelings.<br>Every time I got lost in the past, I didn’t take any photos. How could I bother to take photos? Now my mood is different. I searched all the way to take pictures, catch up on the 10,000 steps to be completed today, and also took the time to eat a bowl of noodles. A colleague bumped into me and asked me what I was doing. I smiled and said that my son was lost and I was looking for him. My colleague looked puzzled. I said it was okay, so I left and kept walking and looking. The department leaders and colleagues were also anxious, but they could definitely see that I was stable and relaxed, and I was smiling all the time.<br>I keep laughing, because this day will come sooner or later. If you want to grow up and enter the society, this kind of thing will come sooner or later. It’s better to come than not to come at all, and it’s better to come early than to come late. I’m laughing in my heart. Once you have security and trust, you should go out into society alone. What is sociality? It’s nothing more than a person leaving early and coming back late.<br>When I left my workplace to finish my noodles and walked 200 meters south, I took a photo with my phone of a store on the roadside that Hamp often paid attention to. At a glance, I saw a figure among the people queuing up in front of Zhengxin Chicken Steak and subconsciously came into view, it was him! He stood in front of the stall and ordered barbecue and chicken steaks, and the boss obeyed and cooked them for him.<br>I took photos. I tapped Hamp on the shoulder and smiled. I smiled and said I have been looking for you for three hours, where have you gone? Hamp was still holding a piece of pineapple in his hand, which he had already eaten half of. The boss handed two skewers of barbecue to him. He also wanted chicken steaks and bought them too. After I paid the money, I asked him where are you going? Hamp looked at me and didn’t answer, because it was hard to answer. why? He originally went to my workplace to look for me, but now that he met me, he stopped going to my work. I asked him where he was going. It was difficult for him to answer. I changed my approach and asked : Are you looking for your father at work? He said yes. I’m still not convinced, I still feel like the communication was not successful. I asked, where is it up there? He said Quarantine(my workplace). It seems that he does know that , which proves that he is really coming to find me.<br>I saw him carrying the backpack I usually carry, and in the backpack were his things that he had packed. He still had his coat draped over one arm. When Teacher Peng returned to the studio, he told us that Hamp had taken the coat away. This proved that Hamp had something in mind and he wanted to take the things home or go to his father. When Hamp was buying barbecue, he stole someone else’s queue. The young man behind him got angry and left without buying. The boss seemed helpless. I explained that there was something different about my child, which confused my boss even more. The boss really couldn’t tell that Hamp was different from normal people, because all the responses were fluent, and the communication when buying things was smooth, natural and firm. Hamp wanted to buy two barbecue skewers and chicken steaks, and he communicated naturally.<br>I posted the Hamp’s photo of queuing up to buy barbecue to the studio group. Hamp’s mom was relieved immediately. We walked a few meters south and came to a tricycle fruit stall, and Hamp said he wanted watermelon. This is where I got the pineapple just now. I gave the boss some extra money, and he was a good person. A person next to me came over and said that the boss was a good person. Yes, there are good people everywhere in society, and this is the basis for children’s recovery.<br>How bold a person is, how productive the land is. For Hamp, that’s exactly what happened. As Hamp’s abilities become higher and higher, the society he faces will inevitably become wider and wider. There is nothing outside the heart. As the heart becomes bigger, there will be more and more things in the heart. I had to find ways to ensure the most basic safety, such as putting a locator watch in my backpack and letting him fly. The kite needs to be flown, and at the same time, the string in your hand cannot be broken.<br>We entered the Jixiangcun subway station and passed the security check channel in front of Hamp. The two little girls at the security check looked at Hamp and murmured to each other in surprise, as if they had discovered something but were not sure. I smiled and said, found him. They are cute and smile brightly. Everyone is paying attention, this is our society.<br>Give your children a chance to go out early and come home late. This opportunity should gradually become normal. This is the real road to recovery. Are many people avoiding this path? Is there a road to recovery other than this? Regardless of recovery, everyone has to enjoy it happily, right?<br>Hamp left the studio at 16:00, and it was 18:30 when we met . It took him 2 and a half hours to walk a little more than 1 kilometer? I walked to my workplace at this speed and I’ll be off from work too! What did he do every moment during these two and a half hours? If there are photos, I would be willing to pay for them! I especially want to see it.<br>When I got back to bed at night, Hamp’s big meal came. He used my phone to type and look for things, look through photos, and take pictures of the boxes of pill boxes he bought. Taking photos, this method really made Hamp more and more aware. The advantage of photos is that they are more convincing than words. If a child who cannot speak can be taught to speak, the words he will say are things that normal people would not say. This is the disadvantage of speaking itself. Photos avoid this drawback.<br>How to promote children? Keep things simple and repetitive, not complicated and empty.<br>Hamp can recite a lot of the language from cartoons without even realizing it! Therefore, PPT must keep up.<br>Hamp can pack up independently and come to see me at work. This opportunity must become a normal thing. Next time, let Teacher Peng tell Hamp to find his father, while I hide and follow him.</p>
