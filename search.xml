    <title>Guide Your Child&#39;s Behavior</title>
    <url>/2023/11/14/anay1114/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>（The following is Hamp’s father’s speech）<br>Let’s ponder a question, one that every parent should ask themselves: “Do I genuinely love my children?” While most parents might instinctively say yes, the reality might be more nuanced.<br>What is love, then? Love is not a mere word; it demands standards. Take a moment to reflect on your feelings when you’re out with your children — be it at a restaurant, on the subway, or in a bank. Is your heart racing with anxiety, or do you feel grounded?<br>If your heart is consistently in your throat, fearing that your children might inconvenience you, it’s worth considering whether this aligns with true love. Genuine love for your children means being present with them, even if it means enduring some discomfort. When parents can let go of constant worries, they find peace within. A serene parental heart offers stability to the child, fostering a sense of security and, in turn, recognizing the parents’ love. After all, it’s the parents’ ability to make their children feel at ease that truly signifies love.<br>Hence, there must be criteria to gauge your love for your children. This criterion lies in your emotional state when with your children—in a restaurant, on the subway, in a bank, or any social setting. Is your heart uplifted or weighed down? If it’s the latter, you genuinely love your children; if it’s the former, you may not truly love them. Why does the heart lift? It lifts when there’s a fear that your child might cause inconvenience, prompting you to preemptively instruct him on how to behave in that setting, asking him not to trouble you. This is what parents typically do—establishing rules upfront. Through reinforcement and guidance, behavior aligns with these rules.<br>How to institute rules?<br>Start by framing the rule as an objective. Then, with reinforcement and guidance, gradually guide the child to meet this goal—allowing the child to achieve and adhere to such a rule. After extended training, the child eventually attains this objective. In reality, the child’s mind is dormant; their thinking is underdeveloped, and their emotions are not fully expressed—they merely mimic such behavior. Despite outward appearances, these children lack genuine spirit. Such regulations aren’t true rules; they’re metaphysical. Rules should evolve through practice, be distilled from experience, and be validated through real-world application.<br>Subway Seat Battle: A Child’s Evolution<br>Phase One: Early Tactics<br>In the initial stage, when my child Hamp was around 3 or 4 years old, we frequently took the subway. Faced with the absence of seats, his instinctive move was to slip his hands beneath people’s buttocks and lift them. Observers, amused by the audacity of a toddler, often surrendered their seats willingly, saying, “Give the baby a seat, give the baby a seat.” And thus, Hamp secured a comfortable spot.</p>
<p>Phase Two: Refining Strategies<br>As Hamp grew to around 4 years old, he refined his approach. Placing both hands under someone’s buttocks to lift proved to be less effective. Some commuters yielded, while others remained resolute. Realizing the limitations of this technique, Hamp adjusted his tactics. Rather than waiting for people to sit, he proactively grabbed the waistbands of those about to settle, ensuring older kids, aged 4 or 5, were the beneficiaries.<br>Phase Three: A Shift in Approach<br>Subsequently, Hamp continued his seat quest but encountered resistance from some commuters. Acknowledging the diminishing success of his previous methods, he reconsidered his strategy. Recognizing that not everyone was inclined to offer a seat, he adopted a subtler approach, opting to tug gently at people’s clothes instead.<br>In Hamp’s quest for a subway seat, his tactics evolved over time. Initially, he boldly placed his hands under seated individuals, insisting they vacate their seats. The message was clear: “You must give up your seat for me.” Later, his approach shifted to grabbing the waistbands of those about to sit, communicating, “This seat is mine; I’ll take it if you don’t yield.” This transition marked a more subdued behavior, signaling that the seat was his by default, with a reminder that others could willingly offer it or face a gentle tug at their clothes.<br>This shift reflects a progression in the child’s behavior. While outwardly it might seem like the child is causing less disturbance or keeping a distance, internally, the child’s comprehension is advancing. The child actively withdraws, not because they were taught not to touch others, but rather as a part of their interactive learning process. In this dynamic interaction, the child learns to navigate and refine their approach.<br>Mastering the Seat Game Without Touching Others<br>As Hamp refined his seat acquisition strategy, he transitioned from physical contact to a more subtle approach. Now, when a seat was sought, Hamp adeptly outpaced others, claiming it before anyone else could. Observers, witnessing the child confidently secure a seat, soon forgot their intention to sit. Previously, Hamp used to signal others to vacate, but now he simply seized the seat.<br>While Hamp’s evolution in seat strategies may seem like an improvement, it signifies active progress. Over time, he honed his tactics, learning how to secure a seat effectively. In the initial stages, when seats were available but unoccupied, Hamp would strategically choose someone with a friendly demeanor, often a middle-aged man. He would approach, slowly position himself with his backside towards the person’s lap, and eventually sit on their lap. Perceiving the tired-looking baby, onlookers would willingly yield the seat.<br>The Deliberate Seating Maneuver: A Playful Trial<br>Why does Hamp execute the gradual sit-down on someone’s lap? It’s a trial, a subtle communication process. It signifies, “I’m interested in this seat; it’s fine whether you grant it or not. If you do, great; if not, that’s okay too. I won’t plop down all at once. What do you say?” It’s a gentle test, an expression of desire for that particular spot.<br>This behavior invites our observation. The child is unmistakably advancing. Such actions are windows into the child’s thoughts. His mind is perfectly typical, hence the unhurried descent onto someone else’s lap.</p>

    <title>Problematic behavior is &quot;corrected.&quot;</title>
    <url>/2023/11/17/anay1117/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A father reached out to me with the following message:<br>“Hello, Hampu’s Father , my son turned eight this year. He is facing significant emotional and behavioral challenges. I’ve been reading your articles recently, and they’ve been quite enlightening. Being a well-known dad like yourself, I find your words deeply moving and greatly appreciate your wisdom and profound insights.<br>My son started speaking at three years old, has been to various institutions, and attended kindergarten. Just as you mentioned, I’ve noticed a shift from a seemingly simple autistic child to one exhibiting signs of neurosis. After reaching a point where he could imitate speech, he seems to have hit a roadblock and now has only a limited amount of active language.<br>His mood and behavior have become more serious, and I understand this is likely because his thinking hasn’t progressed further. His current behavior is quite ‘rebellious,’ and there are several aspects that are particularly concerning:<br>1.As you highlighted in your article, the channels of communication for children seem blocked, making it challenging for them to accept external information. They struggle to comprehend or listen, often resulting in aggressive behaviors. For instance, the persistently extreme spitting behavior, ongoing for over two years, has become a source of distress. The spitting has become more frequent, serving various purposes such as retaliation against denial, seeking attention, or expressing irritation. There are instances where he directly spits in my face. Attempts to communicate or reason with him prove futile, and subsequent occurrences remain unchanged. The parent-child relationship has deteriorated to a point I never anticipated, prompting deep self-reflection. I used to exert force in enforcing desktop learning both at institutions and home, with a rather strong attitude. In the institution, some sensory integration teachers resorted to physical punishment. Given the pressure of quitting my job to care for the children, I occasionally resorted to beating and scolding. Now, I realize that the increasing emotional distance from the child may be significantly linked to these experiences.<br>2.Given the freedom to play, the child’s preferred activities involve climbing bookshelves, cabinets, and playing with power plugs. Climbing to the top of shelves or cabinets, he tends to sweep items like books or clothes onto the floor. I question whether creating a mess in the room brings him satisfaction, as he engages in these activities whenever he has free time. Regarding power plugs, he insists on unplugging them, especially when he sees me charging a device or using the air conditioner. Despite attempts to communicate, he remains unresponsive.<br>3.He falls asleep independently, but upon checking on him, I find him sleeping naked. However, he readily accepts putting on clothes when assisted. I contemplate whether this is an expression of a long-suppressed desire seeking release.<br>4.His thought processes are disorganized and lack clear rules. Examples include urinating in unusual places, such as his car, while being completely naked. Another instance is his habit of picking up and eating things while walking, even when engaged in conversation.<br>I’ve been contemplating the significance of addressing the channel issue as a means to alleviate loneliness. However, many of his actions seem to defy established rules. I wholeheartedly align with your perspective on satisfying children, but I’m grappling with how to effectively intertwine meeting his needs with the establishment of rules. Despite continuous reflection, I haven’t discovered a more effective approach. I believe this demands skill and wisdom. Could you please offer some guidance? Thank you!<br>Dad Hamper: I think that since we have an autistic child, we have also had problems with our vision. All the children’s behaviors are no longer right. Things that we didn’t care about before now start to care about them, and things that used to be right are now no longer right. What should I do if something goes wrong? Then correct it! How to correct it? Stopping children from behaving like that is the worst method most commonly used by parents! If a child is treated like this from an early age, the child will have more and more problematic behaviors when he grows up. Why? Because he went crazy because he was blocked, and his problematic behaviors were all caused by being blocked.<br>It is impossible for a person to accept the fate of being blocked. He will try to get out with the strongest strength. Think about it, if you want others to block you in this way, and if you want others to block you in that way, can you not be crazy? Others will say that what you do is wrong, so they block you to correct you! But you don’t know that what you are doing is wrong. If you know that what you are doing is wrong, you have some ability to correct yourself. What’s more, if you think you are doing the right thing, or if you see the part you are facing, but others deny you, can you not be angry? Why do people always find excuses for themselves? It is to make others feel that they are right. This is the reason for negative reinforcement.<br>I remember six years ago, when Hamp was just like this, I saw a father list the “Ten Don’ts” for his children. First, don’t allow … ; second, don’t allow … ; third, don’t allow. … ; … , tenth, not allowed … . I can’t remember exactly what it was, and I didn’t even have the intention to remember it at the time. In the blink of an eye, our children have grown up in six years. What is the state of his children now?<br>Rather than saying that I have been correcting my child these years, it is better to say that I have been respecting his rights as a human being. One parent severely accused me of doting on my children. Yes, I dote on my children in my heart. I really haven’t thought too much about autism. I once said to my child’s mother, “I’ll just spoil him to death, and I won’t do anything to correct him.” I don’t think I should stop pampering him just because he is autistic. He is still a little kid and I want to pamper my kid. Another thing I pay special attention to is that if the child’s ability cannot improve, such a big deal will actually harm the child. Pampering a child while continuously improving his abilities is respecting his rights as a person. Therefore, respecting a person is not a concept, but a technology. Without technology, there is no respect.<br>Han Pu’s heart is connected to the outside world, so Han Pu is free. If a person is unblocked, it doesn’t matter whether he is autistic or not. Unblocked is more important than the correction of autism. I wonder if correction is just for smoothness? Correction is not just to scare the child. Regardless of whether it is corrected or not, I think allowing children to have unobstructed children is humane, and not allowing children to unobstructed is anti-human. If there is no passage between a person and the outside world or the passage is blocked, can this person not be crazy? If the blood vessels in a person’s body are blocked by lumps everywhere, what kind of living situation will he be in? This is a state of existence in which life is worse than death, and death is impossible even if one wants to die.<br>I admit and accept that my child is autistic, and he will always be autistic, but I just want an autistic child to live a smoother life. In the course of my life with him, I want to make him human. I didn’t think about correcting him, I just kept giving him positive energy and letting him radiate his true self from the heart. I think I should respect him as a person in this way. I can totally imagine the future!<br>An autistic child does not want to be alone. He always wants to get out of loneliness. He has been working hard for this, and he works harder than his parents! An autistic child has the desire and actions to get out of loneliness. All the behaviors of an autistic child are his exploration of getting out of loneliness. Any behavior of a child, whether considered by parents to be bad behavior or good behavior, is the child’s exploration of getting out of loneliness. This is the total function of the child’s behavior.<br>After a child has been blocked for several years, the child will exhibit more and more intense problematic behaviors until the parent is unable to stop the behavior and the parent collapses. When parents collapse and look for solutions, times have changed. The education of autistic children depends on how you start. If you don’t set the stage well at the beginning, it will be bad all the way to the end. This is the same as playing Go. You must have the overall situation in mind at the beginning, but the overall concept comes from practice. How can you have an overall view without starting practice? This is dialectics. Practicing and summarizing every day is a weapon for me to improve my level. If there is no summary, there will be no progress. Only by constantly summarizing can we continue to discover what we have failed to do, continue to understand the essence of ABA, continue to improve ourselves, and continue to have an overall view.<br>The person I am now is much clearer than before, and the person I am in the future will definitely be at a higher level than the person I am now. Someone asked me to come and give a lecture to them. I was happy to go. Even though time was tight, I happily agreed. Why? I try to improve myself once I give a lecture. A lecture lasts four or three hours without a break. I think it will be very frustrating for the audience. My expression makes me grow, and my child’s expression makes my child grow, so I particularly value my child’s expression. Expression is the proof of smoothness. The more you express, the smoother you will be.<br>I remember that I just discovered that something was wrong with Hamp. After we went to the hospital and was diagnosed with autism, I started to pay attention to his behavior, because autism requires behavioral modification. I remembered this sentence at the time. Hamp raised his head and squinted his eyes, looking like a fool. I was very scared. I thought, how could a smart and beautiful child suddenly become a fool? If he does this behavior, I will beat him and scare him. He didn’t know what was going on. A little over three-year-old child just lived in fear. All he knew was that he was afraid of me. All he knew was that his father had changed. It turned out that he no longer had that father. He didn’t understand anything when he behaved like this. I flicked his head and shouted at him. I think my expression was enough to scare him. Sometimes he really peed his pants like this, and his pants got wet like this. The scene in the movie where I was so scared that I wet my pants really happened in reality, and I regretted it very much afterwards.<br>He’s a little older, he’s autistic, but he’s more of a little kid. He did those behaviors, but he didn’t understand anything. My desperate and hysterical look of terror would only make a three-year-old child more frightened. A normal three-year-old child still behaves like a spoiled child in the arms of his parents. Is it just because my child is autistic that he has been hit harder by me? I am his father. If a child scares his father, how can he survive? What did he do wrong? It’s not his fault that he became autistic, and he didn’t want it to be like this. But because he was autistic, he began to suffer inhuman treatment. At that time, I was still thinking about how to scare him and scare him back. I was driving and he was sitting in the back looking for kindergartens and institutions. I looked back at him sitting in the back and he didn’t know anything. I turned around and looked at him with tears streaming down my face in horror. I passed on all this fear to him. He was originally a child. When he smiled stupidly, I slapped him on the shoulder, and the legendary fingerprints immediately appeared in front of my eyes. I don’t know what happened, but I hit him on the thigh with a clothes hanger. A black and blue stain remained forever. Several years later, it is still there. I have also done the ridiculous things that other parents have done. We are just as ridiculous, terrible, ignorant and cruel. I wanted to give myself a good slap, but I couldn’t. Personality determines what I do. Even if I understand a lot of truths, my actions still reveal the dark side of my personality. I need to constantly reflect on myself and cut myself cruelly. If I do the right thing, the child will do the right thing. I once heard my doctoral supervisor say, “Men should be cruel to themselves.” I have to keep moving in a more refined and correct direction, and I have to keep cutting off my problematic behaviors.<br>In the article “Parents Don’t Hurt Their Children a Second Time”, Dabao is an ordinary child and Xiaobao is an autistic child. They play together in an inflatable castle. Dabao pressed Xiaobao down, and Xiaobao couldn’t get up after struggling for a while, so he bit Dabao. Dabao let Xiaobao up, and then told Xiaobao that he was going to beat him, and Xiaobao screamed hysterically. Xiaobao is a very kind person. A look of fear. Xiaobao’s father came over and asked Xiaobao, “What’s wrong? What happened?” Xiaobao cried and said he bit his brother. “Is this right?” his father asked Xiaobao. Xiaobao said “I was wrong”, but Xiaobao was still very angry.<br>Dabao suppresses Xiaobao, which causes Xiaobao to be hurt. Why does this hurt? Because Xiaobao is autistic, he cannot bear such suppression. Because Xiaobao’s way of getting rid of being hurt was inappropriate, he was educated by his father. The father wanted his child not to bite people in the future. Xiaobao admitted that he was wrong. This was the second time Xiaobao was hurt. In fact, this was the third injury. The first injury was when he became autistic. Because there was a first injury, there was a second injury. Because there is a second injury, there is also a third injury. It seems to be correcting the child’s behavior, but it does not understand the rationality of the child’s behavior. If you cannot see the rationality of your child’s behavior and cannot respect such rationality, there will be no correction. Any correction that fails to look at a child’s behavior in a positive light is likely to create more problematic behaviors because it violates positive thinking. Although the child is autistic, we still need to see the rationality in autism. In this sense, problem behavior is”corrected” in this way. In fact, the more we correct, the more mistakes we make, and the more we correct, the more problems we have. The word ‘correct’ can be replaced by ‘mess’, which can express the meaning better.<br>Let’s look at the question raised by the father at the beginning of this article. The child’s emotional and behavioral problems are serious. After years of intervention, why have the behaviors and emotions become more serious? How is such an intervention accomplished? Where there’s a block, there must be a release; this is differential reinforcement. Only blocking without releasing constitutes negative behavior, while only releasing without blocking is a positive mindset. The outcome of merely blocking without releasing is the exacerbation of a child’s behavioral and emotional issues. Releasing without blocking requires the development of certain tools, much like when we need to alleviate a dammed-up lake, where we need tools such as excavators. I wanted Hamp to be able to say some vocabulary words, so I asked him to sit down and learn from me, but he didn’t want to. If he doesn’t want to and I have to force him to sit down, this is blocking him. Isn’t it just for the purpose of blocking him to gain access to this knowledge? I didn’t go to school with the goal of sitting in class. He is autistic, and I want him to sit down and learn the knowledge, but he is unwilling to sit down, and I am unwilling to block him to prevent him from running away. I made the knowledge into a video and put it on my mobile phone. Hamp flipped through it and watched it by himself. I didn’t force him, he took the initiative to watch it. When these contents are uploaded and he is asked to sit down, he will have the ability to sit down. Only then will he be blocked to put a certain amount of pressure on him. Such pressure will not cause harm to him. Stress causes harm to children because the child’s ability cannot withstand such pressure. If the child’s ability can withstand such pressure, then such pressure is not harm. At this time, it is entering the stage of congestion and relaxation, which is the fast lane for children to progress. Later, there will be more obstruction than negligence. I will not praise him if he do good things, but it will not work if he do negative things. I have entered this stage with Hamp now, because he has already had his outlet, and he must behave accordingly. Yeah, He can’t just let it go if he understand it. This kind of pressure is equivalent to pressing a spring, which will allow children to gain momentum and make rapid progress.<br>It can be said that intervention needs to go through three stages sequentially: having a release, having both a release and a block, and having a block. These stages follow the order of positive reinforcement, differential reinforcement, and negative reinforcement. However, if the third stage is placed at the beginning, it will lead towards more emotional and behavioral problems. When a child exhibits negative behavior, and a parent blocks it, the child responds with another negative behavior, and if the parent blocks again, this becomes a cycle of continually reinforcing negative behavior through negative reinforcement.<br>The process of enhancing a child’s abilities goes from logic to behavior and then to language, but this sequence is often reversed. Parents typically try to correct a child’s behavior or impart wisdom by speaking, which is futile and can lead to more problematic behavior and language in the future. Why? Because the inherent logic hasn’t taken root within the child. I believe the order should be logic, then behavior, and finally language. Logic is the root, behavior is the trunk, and language is the branches and leaves. Seven-tenths of the effort should be at the root, two-tenths in the trunk, and one-tenth in language. Parents who don’t know how to build the root end up putting all their effort into behavior and language. Furthermore, non-verbal behavior is not executed well, so parents who rely solely on verbal communication end up with a tree that is heavily laden at the top and collapses under its own weight. Logic is conveyed through non-verbal means, and within non-verbal communication, there’s a sequence from the obvious to the subtle. I start with the most subtle aspects of logic, where silence triumphs over sound, and inaction surpasses action. It’s somewhat reminiscent of the wisdom in Laozi’s Tao Te Ching, “Act without doing, work without effort,” and I’m beginning to understand that.<br>The dad mentioned, “He falls asleep alone. But every time I went in to see him, I found that he was sleeping naked, and then I helped him put on clothes, and he accepted it.” I think if it’s acceptable, just accept it. Address the most clear and urgent issues first. Once that’s done, what about the gray areas? Children have their own internal views and behaviors; they tend to categorize the gray areas into black, gray, and white. Behavior has three stages or types: black, which is the least desirable; gray, the ambiguous zone; and white, the positive behavior. The sequence for behavior intervention is to start with the darkest, positively shaping it. If it’s something you can overlook, then let it be; maintain good behavior. If, at the beginning, you intervene in both black and gray behaviors, the child won’t understand boundaries. Parents who don’t recognize boundaries can’t teach their children to differentiate thoughts. What about sleeping naked? Should you intervene or not? How to intervene? When to intervene?<br>When a child’s behavior violates the norm, there is a shaping process. What is the ladder? There is also a cognitive issue among parents. If the behavior that violates the norm reaches the lowest level that others can accept, should they control it or ignore it? We tend to fill up the space and leave no room for children. Children no longer have the process of independent development.</p>

    <title>Hamp messes around in the kitchen cooking all day, but Chengguo never goes into the kitchen</title>
    <url>/2025/12/22/anay12222/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>（The following is an article by Cheng Guo’s mother）<br>Chengguo turns eighteen this year. From the age of two until seven, I put him through on-and-off interventions. Even though I doubted those interventions in my mind, in action I kept going. Because when a family lives together, it’s either you intervene with me or I intervene with you—life doesn’t stop.</p>
<p>I remember when he was five or six: he could even fry an egg himself. He went into the kitchen wanting to cook something, and I taught him how to pour oil. After that, he never went into the kitchen again.</p>
<p>Later, it became spoon-feeding him, because letting food get cold is bad for the stomach, and reheating it again and again is troublesome. I also wanted him to finish sooner so I could wash the dishes. And the way he struggled with eating wasn’t “proper,” and it bothered me to watch. The principle of intervention is that rules come first, people come second. You treat eating as a task to be completed and ignore the child’s feelings in their body and stomach.</p>
<p>From around the time he was seven or eight, I began learning to align my thoughts and actions, but the lingering afterheat of intervention never fully went away. Around age seven, the aftereffects of intervention started to show up little by little. His emotions began having problems—he would cry easily, feeling wronged. At amusement parks, if other kids wanted to play with him, he would hit or shove them, no matter how young or old they were; they couldn’t even get close.</p>
<p>After he turned ten, the aggressive behavior worsened—for example, he hit a security screener because the screener told him to take his bag off for inspection, and wouldn’t let him through otherwise. He would also gouge at other people’s eyeballs—suddenly, with no warning. There was no cause at the time, and I wasn’t on guard.</p>
<p>Even after letting go for more than ten years, the hitting still happens occasionally—maybe once or twice a year.</p>
<p>Around 1:00 a.m. on August 14, 2025, Chengguo ran over to Grandma’s place across the way to eat. For him, this was a historic breakthrough, and I want to record this moment. Some kids—if you stop them once—they might retreat for two years, or five years, or ten years. If you say something about what they’re doing, they’ll stop doing it. Chengguo is the kind of “autistic kid” who easily retreats.</p>
<p>Still in his staying-up-late phase, Chengguo didn’t sleep at all that night, and didn’t nap during the day either. He ate breakfast and lunch, and in the afternoon he went to the shop with his dad. A little after 6 p.m., he got home and fell asleep without eating dinner. He woke up after 10 p.m., and around 1 a.m.—probably hungry—he went to Grandma’s place across the hall to eat.</p>
<p>He even dug out a pot that hadn’t been used in a long time, hooked it up with water, and poured who-knows-what into it. That action is super simple for us, but extremely hard for Chengguo—and in ten years, he had never done anything like that.</p>
<p>Later we asked him what was in the pot, and he said, “Forget it, don’t ask,” so we shut up. Grandma said that the paper she used to wipe the range hood fell into the congee pot, so she poured the congee out. Chengguo saw there was no congee left to drink, so he wanted to make some himself.</p>
<p>Grandma said that when she heard noise in the kitchen and realized it was Chengguo, she didn’t say anything and didn’t come out—because I had told her to try not to interfere and to let go as much as possible. Grandma also knows that if she comes out, Chengguo will let her do everything.</p>
<p>Hamp messes around in the kitchen cooking all day, but Chengguo never goes into the kitchen. Still, with all those years of cooking photos as a foundation, it’s not that Chengguo can’t cook—he just doesn’t want to. Cooking skills are never the real issue; what’s needed is the emotional energy, the will to want to cook. But once he’s taken this first step, things should move much faster from here on.</p>

    <title>Does Hamp have to wash his hands?</title>
    <url>/2023/11/13/skills1123/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Upon arriving home, Hamp’s father instructed him to wash his hands, a task Hamp consistently resisted. When his father insisted, the four or five-year-old responded with frustration, banging his head against the wall. His aim was to encounter something painful, seeking out hard corners like switches to touch. Fearing harm, Hamp’s father intervened just before his head touched the wall, offering his hand for the child to touch. When Hamp raised his head, his father withdrew his hand.<br>In attempting to deter a child, Hamp’s father advocates for using the least force, a concept he terms “the least amount of stopping.” This approach, “minimum obstruction,” strives to grant children maximum freedom. In pursuit of touch, Hamp would maneuver to avoid his father’s hand repeatedly, and the process would continue. It’s a back-and-forth, a repetition of explanations by Daddy Hamp. This, according to him, is a form of training, and Papa Hamp finds it endlessly engaging.<br>Hamp’s father isn’t afraid of Hamp’s touch; he’s concerned about Hamp’s pain. The aim of Hamp’s father’s intervention was to address Hamp’s discomfort, not just to prevent his touch. Expressing his intentions accurately, with minimal interference, Hamp’s father’s actions align with his sentiments—no more, no less. This principle, “the heart and the actions are consistent,” ensures the clear transmission of Hamp’s father’s meaning to his children through precise actions.<br>Despite Hamp’s father’s efforts, Hamp’s goal remains to cease the behavior only when it becomes painful. Consequently, Hamp’s father finds it necessary to administer a painful touch once or twice. While he acknowledges the discomfort, Hamp’s father deems it a manageable issue, feeling the pain and ceasing the touch.<br>Rather than employing force, Hamp’s father opts for a gentler approach to coax Hamp into washing his hands. When Hamp’s head hurts upon touching, it alarms his father. The intention here is to dissuade Hamp through an understanding response. Strong parents may resort to force for control, while less assertive children might resort to self-harm to assert control over their parents. Each employs their strategies. The root of many behavioral issues in children often lies in resistance and the desire for control over their parents. Therefore, the problem isn’t the child’s behavior but the parents’ attempts to exert control. The issue lies in the parents’ inclination toward control. Ideally, parent-child relationships should be based on equality, not control.<br> Hamp’s father won’t fear if Hamp doesn’t touch him in pain, and Hamp won’t be able to control his father. To assert control over Hamp’s father, he deliberately inflicts pain, genuinely hurting him. The child’s self-injury is authentic, not feigned, as it serves as a means of controlling the parent.<br>Around the age of seven or eight, Hamp’s method of expressing anger involves taking the elevator to the 18th floor and sitting there. Subsequently, he might run to the elevator door crying. This behavior doesn’t pose harm, and Hamp’s father isn’t concerned. At approximately 12 or 13 years old, he starts going out, slamming the door behind him. Worried that the door might be forced open, Hamp’s father resorts to using some force to secure the buffer inside.<br>On one occasion, when Hamp’s father asked him to wash his hands, Hamp was on the verge of going out to vent. Offering a towel, Hamp’s father suggested wiping his hands clean. Wiping with the towel disrupted Hamp’s thoughts of going out. Surprisingly, he completed the hand-wiping, strolling to the sofa instead of leaving. Although this outward behavior satisfied Father Hamp, the inner anger remained unexpressed. If the child harbors anger, it’s crucial to allow expression rather than suppressing it. Dad Hamp should strive to maintain consistency in his approach.<br>When a child is angry, attempting to intervene is not behavior modification; real modification is refraining from actions that provoke anger in the first place. Hence, behavior modification always targets parents.<br>If there’s no harm in skipping handwashing upon returning home, leave it be, preventing a cascade of subsequent problematic behaviors. Many behavioral issues arise from enforced actions. The initial imposition generates a sequence of problematic behaviors. By avoiding the initial provocation, subsequent issues may never arise.<br>Forcing a child to engage in undesired activities fosters the child’s “inconsistency in action.” Why do adults compel children? What motivates adults to nurture a child’s “inconsistency in thought and action”?<br>Is handwashing essential? Must it be done every time? If I skip it, will I surely fall ill? What’s the likelihood of getting sick with less washing? Will it lead to severe or minor illness? Often, adults magnify low-probability events, plunging into boundless panic. This amplification of consequences propels children. Why can adults compel children? Because adults wield significant power. The core reason for controlling children is the fear embedded in adults’ hearts. Releasing excessive fear enables both adults and children to live more tranquilly.<br>In Hamp’s childhood, his father frequently enforced handwashing, but gradually, this control lessened. For other activities, like face-washing, letting go poses no harm, and Hamp’s dad isn’t bothered. Presently, Hamp skips washing his face.<br>If skipping handwashing is possible this time, forget it. If it’s imperative, and the child resists, some force might be necessary. Forcibly taking him to wash is strong, met with strong resistance. Using wet paper towels minimizes force, reducing resistance. Employing “minimal force” grants children maximum freedom while addressing the issue. It not only minimizes coercion but also resolves the problem, ensuring satisfaction for both children and parents—a test of parental integration skills.<br>Gentle coercion or positive reinforcement is an option. Washing hands could be tied to fulfilling one of their wishes, fostering a sense of joy and proactive handwashing. However, this still constitutes a form of control, deploying authority over children and creating an uneven dynamic. Therefore, it should be used judiciously and infrequently. Moreover, it might lead to a misconception, with children associating handwashing solely with obtaining rewards, not understanding the correct cause-and-effect relationship—washing hands because they are dirty.<br>To establish the true cause-and-effect relationship, the hands can be wetted, soap applied, and when touched to the white porcelain surface of the basin, black fingerprints appear. This visually demonstrates the rationale for handwashing, enabling the child to perceive the reason and lessening any discomfort.<br>By presenting the authentic cause-and-effect scenario, the child comprehends the purpose behind washing hands, addressing this particular aspect of autism. Whether to wash, or how to do it, becomes the child’s personal challenge, now that the reason is clear.<br>Long-term neglect of handwashing is unrealistic. Some children enjoy playing with water, washing their hands every few days during playtime or when bathing. However, Hamp’s father often assumes his child never washes hands, leading to unnecessary panic.</p>
<p>Consider this scenario: if a child goes a whole year without handwashing, scratches, eats without falling sick, and repeats this without consequences, he might continue the behavior. Conversely, if he goes a year without handwashing, falls sick multiple times, and experiences the repercussions, he may wake up to the importance of hand hygiene. This is when genuine knowledge is acquired. Parents should recognize that this process is lengthy and challenging. Children truly grasp cause and effect when they feel it physically; preaching and interference seldom create such awareness.</p>
<p>A child with diverse physical sensations develops a better understanding. Although this process is more extended for autistic children, it establishes a solid foundation. Autistic parents comprehend the nuances of Hamp’s father’s lifestyle. Healthy individuals might overlook health, but the sick truly appreciate it. Deep feelings contribute to a profound understanding. While normal individuals gain deep understanding through personal experiences, without a foundation, preaching falls on deaf ears. With a foundation, children grasp many concepts automatically, rendering preaching unnecessary. Therefore, in various situations, silence is golden—a task for parents.<br>Communication is a tool, and silence is also a mode of communication. For instance, when Hamp threw the egg on the ground, his father, Hamp’s dad, remained silent. Hamp pondered over the silent response, interpreting it as an indication that the exchange had concluded. Communication is about the transmission of meaning, not confined to verbal expression. Many mistakenly perceive communication as solely reliant on spoken words, which is a narrow view.<br>A practical demonstration involves wetting your hands, applying hand sanitizer, rubbing your hands, and then touching the washbasin. Black lines appear on the white porcelain, representing the dirt that has been washed away. After rinsing your hands and touching the washbasin again, the darkness disappears. This process is akin to connecting points into a chain, capturing key moments and stringing them together. Photograph these key points, creating a photo chain. Develop a video from this photo chain, featuring words like “clean,” “dirty,” and “washed.” In essence, capturing moments for educational materials is more impactful than studying methods to interfere with children’s behavior.</p>

    <title>Every mother has expectations for her child’s future</title>
    <url>/2023/09/24/test02/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Every mother has expectations for her child’s future. What are these expectations?<br>The child is now 8 years old. What are your goals for the child? Everyone has goals, high or low. It is impossible without goals. Goals determine your attitude and methods.<br>I hope there will be no problem in taking care of myself. What is self-care? Knows heat and cold, knows hunger. Children’s patience is greater than ours. When my children’s patience has not reached its limit, I have reached its limit. Children silently endure more than we do. The child really wants to be assertive, but he can’t defeat his mother.<br>Be independent, not dependent on your mother, and know what to do every day. What can I do by myself in the morning? What can I do by myself in the afternoon? I can arrange my daily life by myself and be emotionally stable. The second is to get married, live happily, and regulate the marital relationship. Leave him a house in the future. If I leave my child now, he will be able to dress and cook, but when his mother is around, he will not do it. If the child has some money, he can go out and buy some. Relatives at home can visit him from time to time. The premise is that the child has the ability to work hard on his own. If you are hungry in the morning, you can cook for yourself. When the environment changes, especially in a new environment, children can find the direction without panic and know the direction well.<br>In the morning, I saw Yang Ma off, and Hamp also went. Hamp pushed me to say noodles, meaning to go home and eat noodles. The breakfast at home is noodles. When you let go of your children from an early age, they will have the seeds of their own opinions in the environment. The second is to do better and better. As long as the child’s love for his father does not disturb the child’s heart or expression, the seeds in his heart will sprout and grow.<br>The environment’s acceptance of Hamp. Hamp was not allowed to attend a lecture before, and he was very aggrieved. Hamp educated us, and later we no longer refused him in lectures. Hamp was free in the lecture environment. Later, his behavior did not interfere with us. Later, the child could stand on the podium and we talked about his inner thoughts. Environment plus acceptance of children. After so many years, I have found that acceptance is the foundation. It is still a question of acceptance and the level of the standard line of acceptance.<br>The mentality and methods in the process are limited by the goal or the perception of the results. High goals will lead to better methods and mentality in the process. Low goals will make your approach and mentality worse during the process. The goal has little to do with the child’s current ability. The goal is a feeling that is embedded in the heart.<br>I don’t think it will be a problem for my children to live independently, nor will travel be a problem. It will be no problem to have a job that makes money for them to live on for the rest of their lives. It will also be no problem to get married and take care of the family at home. Under the guidance of this goal, I think there is nothing wrong with the child’s current status. Seize what is essential and don’t get hung up on secondary factors or minutiae. Moreover, under the guidance of this goal, I went more into the deepest part of my heart to change my personality that was difficult to change before.<br>When I went to Yuntai Mountain, my child bought and bought again. I thought it was too much, so I started asking him to eat and buy again and eat and buy again. I was very angry. I couldn’t listen to anything in the heat of the moment. I met the most stubborn person in my personality. part, it’s hard to shake. In fact, the source is that I still don’t treat my child as a normal child. If I always remember my future goals, then I won’t get angry in the moment and will act more rationally. The higher the goal, the more inward the part of your personality that needs to be changed becomes. The easy-to-change parts have been changed, and the rest is the hard part. As long as you have ambitious goals, you can break down hard bones. He knows how much the child eats and drinks, and he knows that it is not what I thought.<br>Once, there was an emotional freeze between the adults. The atmosphere was not right, and the child made faces at Da Cong, hoping that the atmosphere would relax and everyone would be harmonious. The adults laughed later, but the children cried in grievance.<br>Hamp was in the house and everyone was taking a nap. Hamp painted his works on the wall with paint alone. Everyone took photos and recorded them. No one stopped the child. On the contrary, the child’s wanton creation allowed everyone to discover the child’s inner world. This makes everyone happy! We have implemented this educational philosophy in practice.<br>The real solution will come when the solution is no longer possible.<br>Human happiness lies in the spiritual world. In the material world, I don’t know if there is happiness. I think we can only find it in the spiritual world. Material freedom? Spiritual freedom? I think it’s still a matter of spiritual freedom. Most of it lies in the brain.<br>The autistic child was in a disadvantaged situation, and I bullied him. I was very angry, but he had to come over to comfort me, and I rejected him. Why is this? Human weakness is really hard to change. I want to work hard to change this key point in my personality.<br>Children are freer in the environment, and I am more open-minded. Children can obtain good behaviors, emotions, and expressions, but at the same time they may have an impact on others and may be made a fuss about, but this is the objective environment. I try to give my children as much freedom as possible. I should also be able to deal with the environment and others calmly, turn conflicts into friendship, and not be enemies with others, let alone children. This requires me to change the hard points in my personality.<br>I want to protect my child on the dark road to normality in the future. Because he will eventually normalize, why don’t I protect him during this process?<br>My goals for my children: they can stay at home by themselves; they can take care of their own food, drink, and clothes; they can reasonably arrange their own enjoyable life instead of a barren and abnormal life; they can walk independently in the city. In society, if you can reasonably handle your own social scope, you must have a clear mind; you can have a money-making model to survive, and you should create a situation, or even the overall situation; you have a certain breadth and height in the field of knowledge, and you can understand College mathematics, logic, overall planning, and systems science; have your own favorite healthy exercise methods and like to delve into research;  children must establish a positive value system.</p>

    <title>The normalization of Hamp has been obvious</title>
    <url>/2023/09/24/test03/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I really started to respect him and treat him as a normal boy. It turned out that he had not been in my heart and eyes for so many years. It turns out that for so many years, all I had in my mind was an autistic person who couldn’t do anything. Later, this feeling became numb and became subconscious!<br>Now, starting to become stronger, I have him in my eyes. I just realized that I should respect him! I found that I could no longer underestimate him.<br>Let me review my life for the five days from October 15th to October 19th . Life these days has become a normal state.<br>October 15th :<br>This day is Saturday. It’s raining outside and it’s cold. Hamp added a thin coat to himself. In the morning, after our meeting at China Garden, we went to the old place on Wenhua Road to buy big-faced chicken steak. In the past, I usually bought chicken steak, then went to a noodle shop next door, and then went to watch a movie. Because there is a concert at 2pm. I asked Hamp whether to go to a movie or a concert. He chose the concert and we didn’t go to the movie. On the way home that night, he told me to go see a movie tomorrow. Only when I give my children full freedom can they arrange their lives reasonably. You can watch a movie anytime, but there is only one concert. Let’s watch the concert first. This is his choice. So, he told me to watch a movie the next day.<br>Attending concerts, he loved it. Follow the whole process. I don’t know if I understand it or not, but I’m not going out to play anyway. I said let’s go first and stop looking, but he didn’t. In the end, Hamp won the first prize. His seat number was 262, which was lucky. The prize is a 12- hole ocarina.<br>While we were waiting for the bus back home, Hamp took photos of a few of us. We are asked to squat and we are asked to stand. He also took a photo of a couple.<br>October 16 :<br>Woke up early in the morning, Hamp made some medicine and drank it, brushed his teeth, and we went out without breakfast. We took bus 18 to watch a movie at Wenhua Road North Third Ring Station. He knew that bus 16 was for the train station and bus 18 was for going to the movies. bus 16 costs 5 yuan, bus 18 costs 2 yuan. When we can take bus 18 or bus 16 , even if bus 16 comes first, he can still wait for bus 18 . When we arrived at the end, we went to the old place to buy big-faced chicken steak, but the store wasn’t open yet. We arrived at 9:51 and the store will open at 10 o’clock. We left and went to Beijin Building. The building wasn’t open either, so we turned around and went to KFC for breakfast. KFC does not have breakfast after 10 o’clock. It was already past 10 o’clock when we arrived at KFC. After ordering food, Hamp waited with a sign while I went to use the restroom. When I came back, Hamp had already started eating. He can buy movie tickets, select seats, and collect tickets by password. The hibiscus vegetable soup was too hot, so he added ice cubes or mineral water. After watching a movie, we went downstairs to the first floor and passed a shop where we ate. Hamp took several bottles of drinks and opened them all. When leaving, he put the ones with lids on and took the ones without lids. Hamp smiled happily when he saw the funny video on his phone. After returning to school, I rode my bike to buy Guangxi Golden Chuanzi. I was riding a bicycle across the zebra crossing. I felt it was dangerous and I gave him a shout. I guess the noise confused him. I said there was no car and I passed quickly, but he backed away. I found out I was wrong.</p>
<p>After returning to school, we go home. I got a call to pick up a package and Hamp went home alone. When I came back downstairs 30 minutes later, the lights were on. He opened the door for me and put the key on the shoe cabinet at the door. He has gone to bed.<br>October 17 : Monday. Hamp got up earlier than me. He made his own medicine and drank it. I made my own steamed buns with eggs. After school, go to Lu Sanguo for dinner. He ordered four dishes. It was too much for just the two of us, so I suggested he order Kung Pao Chicken. He took pictures of me. What should I do if I can’t eat so much at one time? He told me to eat shredded pork with Beijing sauce tomorrow, spicy tofu the day after tomorrow, and a large plate of chicken the day after tomorrow. When ordering food, he would look for words he didn’t know. Hamp’s handwriting is good and artistic. I went to Dennis to buy some fruits and he said Zhang Dingbang Village.</p>
<p>While taking a shower at night, he repaired the leaking shower head pipe. He did most of the repairs himself, and I did the most critical work.<br>October 18 :<br>Today is tuesday. When I woke up in the morning, there was a power outage and breakfast was not made. We arrived at school. I went to buy breakfast 2 kilometers away, but Hamp didn’t go. I brought him a carton of pure milk. Hamp asked me to go back and get the grapes, and I went home and got them for him. He wants to take away the key again, and he wants to go home and get the rest of the fruit. I told him to hurry up or else he would miss the bus. When he heard this, he came back, gave me the key and asked me to go back and get it. He’s here watching. When passing Grandma Cui, Hamp said little pudding, making everyone laugh.</p>
<p>I woke up this morning thinking about little pudding! Thinking about it, I was like this when I was a child. I especially liked playing billiards. Every morning when I arrived at the host’s house early, he hadn’t gotten up yet. There was a power outage today and I couldn’t steam rice, so grandma in the kitchen made steamed buns. There is electricity in Zhang Dingbang Village, so Teacher Tang and I messaged on WeChat. Hamp could understand. When Hamp came back to my classroom in the afternoon, the first thing he said was money! I took one yuan to buy some pudding. He was still thinking about what was most important to him.<br>After school in the afternoon, he went to Lu Sanguo. He wanted to take a tricycle, but the tricycle was driven away by someone else. He just waited, but couldn’t wait any longer, so he rode away. When ordering, he only wrote down the shredded pork with Beijing sauce and rice he wanted to eat today. I bought Dahongpao, Chili King, and fermented bean curd in the supermarket. I’m homesick and I don’t have any gas anymore. Why buy these?<br>I found out the next day that he was going to take him to Zhang Dingbang Village for cooking. He made fruit salad on the mountain. I don’t know if the teacher told him to buy these things, or if he thought about it himself.<br>Yesterday when I was riding across the street, I gave Hamp a fight. When I crossed the road today, I was far behind. I thought I didn’t care, but from afar I saw Hamp waiting for me. Until I came to him, he was pushing his bicycle and he was walking across the road. It seems that I gave him a good deal of noise, but did not knock him out. He understood, so he did it. He has his own way to solve the problems he encounters. He is proactive. This is the ability that children must develop.<br>In the evening I asked him what he had eaten yesterday, today, tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. He told me everything in detail.<br>October 19 :</p>
<p>I got up in the morning , picked up his things and went to school. After arriving in the mountains, going to the wild and returning home, he cooked a few dishes. Spicy tofu, fried vegetables with eggs. Teachers at Nature House send photos of children to our Nature House group every day. Children’s education lies in such details, thank you! Hamp’s blowout development this year is partly due to the basis of consistency, and partly due to the conditions for the blowout. He is very close to every teacher here and often talks about them, especially Grandma Zhang. Grandma Zhang went to Beijing for a month, and Han Pu asked how many days she would have. Grandma Zhang came back. She was happy and embarrassed to see Grandma Zhang after seeing her for a long time, standing aside and laughing. Eighteen is a teacher who used to take care of Hamp. He went home to work. Hamp talked about him, and he sent the location and photos for Hamp to see. Hamp could understand.<br>Some thoughts:<br>Miracles are not miracles, miracles are normal things. Because the direction is wrong, normality becomes an impossible miracle in the mind.<br>Traveling across thousands of mountains and rivers, I looked back silently, but that person was there in the dim light. The moment he lowered his head, he discovered the path under his feet. I think the way is to eat, drink, have fun and write books. To put it more loftily, practice brings true knowledge. I would also like to add that practice is free.<br>Many parents are trying to rehabilitate their children while thinking that it is impossible for their children to recover. Discussions among parents in the WeChat group are very lively and intense, and I think this is normal. Since it is normal, the child must enter. It would be great if children could argue as fiercely as we do. However, many parents will say, isn’t that normal? How is that possible? I thought to myself that while we were having a heated exchange of ideas about educating children, what I was thinking in my mind was that autism could never be cured. what are you doing then? Just to make yourself happy?<br>All the photos I take are understandable to children. I believe that one day, Hamp will be able to understand all these articles I have written, and this day is not too far away. I believe that one day, like me, he will start writing his own articles, and that day will be closer.</p>

    <title>When Hamp goes missing</title>
    <url>/2023/09/26/test05/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>I got up at around 6 o’clock this morning, had dinner, and left Qinshui Community with Hamp to go to the studio in Taibai Community. It takes one and a half hours from Qinshui Community to Taibai Community . Walk from Qinshui Community to Changlepo Subway Station, take the subway for 2 stops to Tonghuamen, change to Line 3 and take 9 stops to Taibai South Road Subway Station. After exiting the station, walk east for about 1 kilometer to Taibai Community. Taibai Community is between Jixiangcun Subway Station and Taibai South Road Subway Station, and is adjacent to Taibai South Road Subway Station. Once or twice, we took the Jixiangcun subway station and walked west for more than 1 kilometer to Taibai Community. One kilometer due north of Jixiangcun Metro Station is my unit inspection bureau. It seems that one time when we were going to Taibai Community from Jixiangcun subway station, when we passed the intersection, I asked Hamp what was to the north? I told him it was the Quarantine Bureau.<br>After arriving at Taibai Community, I chatted with Gu Guo’s mother, Teacher Peng, and several former Xunyu parents, and then I went to work. At noon, I cycled back to Taibai from my workplace, had a meal together, took a lunch break, and then cycled back to my workplace to go to work. It takes 10 minutes to ride to the unit.<br>There was a meeting at work in the afternoon. Just after the meeting, at 16:20 , Teacher Peng sent a WeChat message saying that Hamp was missing. Hamp opened the door at 16 o’clock and left. When Teacher Peng discovered that Hamp was missing, Hamp had been gone for several minutes. Teacher Peng went downstairs to look for Hamp. After searching for more than ten minutes, he still couldn’t find him. Then he sent me a WeChat message to tell me.<br>Hamp was lost, for the first time. In the past few times, I was so anxious that I couldn’t stand up, lost my mind, and was extremely worried. I thought about all the possibilities, and the more I thought about it, the more scared I became. After I heard this this time, I told Teacher Peng that it was okay and I would come look for him. I was very calm. I didn’t pretend to be calm, and I didn’t tell myself to be strong, but I was very, very calm, even calmer than usual. When the child is older, if he cannot take this step, if he cannot walk independently and go home in society, what is the meaning of so many years of rehabilitation education?<br>I thought about it and I thought he took the subway back to Changlepo. I got up and left the unit, took a motorcycle, and went to the Taibai South Road subway station to look for him, but couldn’t find him. I showed Hamp’s photo to the subway entrance security employee and she said she didn’t see him. Hamp is more prominent and easily impresses others.<br>When I turned around and walked out of the subway station, I happened to meet Teacher Peng coming in. Teacher Peng was very anxious, but she said I was very calm. I calmed down and I was able to calm her down. I said it was okay, such a big child was not lost, but simply lost contact.<br>She said she asked the owner of the store in the east gate of the community, but she didn’t see Hamp. We entered Taibai Community together from the north gate and walked back to the studio without seeing Hamp. Teacher Peng continued to search in the community.<br>I rode to the Jixiangcun subway station. When I entered the station, I asked the security employees but they didn’t see Hamp. I showed them Hamp’s photo. I left the subway station and walked towards my workplace. Teacher Fan called me and took the subway to Changlepo. As a result, Chengguo’s mother also went to Changlepo, and so did Li Hua.<br>I was at the intersection of Jixiangcun subway station, and I went into Qiulin Company in the northwest corner. I went in and walked around, found EMI chicken, took a photo, and went to the toilet. I thought to myself that it would be exhausting for us to look for him, so he could only look for us. I believe that children have this ability, and I am willing to give them such opportunities. I walked to my workplace, but I didn’t see Hamp along the way. I returned to the office and sat for a while, drank some water, and then went downstairs. Then I went back and told the guard on duty at my unit that if my son comes, intercept him and call me.<br>Opposite the office building is a good noodle shop. I went in and had a big bowl of handmade noodles, which tasted very authentic, and a bowl of soup. During the meal, Han Ma called me and asked me where to find it, how to find it, should I contact the bus terminal, and so on. I was embarrassed to say I was eating, so I said I was looking. After I was full, I left the noodle shop and went to Taibai Community.<br>My analysis is that if Hamp wanders off, he will return to the studio. Either take the subway home or go to my workplace to find me.Hamp’s mom is at home. It’s been more than two hours, and Hamp hasn’t gotten home yet. He didn’t go to my workplace either. Then just hang out in Taibai Community. There are two passages on the way to Taibai Community. One is to take South Second Ring Road and Yongsong Road, and the other is to take Hanguang Road and Jixiang Road. At the fork in the road, I thought for a moment and decided that I should take the second passage. Because we had never walked through the first passage, and I never told him. I have never walked through the first passage, but I told him about it before.<br>I am analyzing that Hamp has a strong sense of purpose and will not run around. Either go back to Taibai, go back to Qinshui Community, or go to my workplace to find me. He also has the ability to starve to death, and he can strongly demand the boss to give him something to eat. He ate other people’s food without paying , and if someone stopped him and called the police, I would have found him because I had already called 110 and filed a report. As long as he does not touch the bottom line of social norms, it means that he is now walking freely in society and does not cause obstacles to others. This means that he has good rules. If he encounters the bottom line of social norms, he will be found.<br>Besides, people in society are becoming brighter and brighter now, and there are good people everywhere. I believe in this society even more. If he touches the bottom line of social norms, Hamp can still tell his father’s phone number and where he lives without others calling the police. After such an analysis, I felt safe, calm, and surprisingly calm. When I lost contact, I believed in my son. Although we can’t find a phone number or contact us, our hearts are connected under this starry sky. The highest level of the connection between heart express and heart express is the connection between hearts. I can feel the power of faith.<br>Losing contact will become the norm for children. They go out by themselves in the morning and come home at night. This is the norm, and this is the way in and out of society. Social skills require thinking and growing in real society. This kind of loss of contact is a testimony of the child’s ability and is also necessary for the child. It is normal for an autistic child to be able to fully establish himself in society and do things by himself. This is just the beginning, so there is no need to make a fuss. If I make a fuss, it shrinks the child’s space, which is not good for the child’s development.<br>True gold must be refined from fire, and true gold is not afraid of fire. If a child does not have the opportunity to go out early and come home late, can he be considered a member of society? Now that Hamp’s abilities have arrived, my heart is at peace. Hamp’s mother called and said that she was restless and didn’t know what to do. I said that’s because you don’t understand. Just like me, when I was diagnosed with chronic atrophic gastritis, I fell into panic. Several doctors told me that it was fine and there was nothing to worry about, but I just couldn’t sit still because I didn’t understand. Regarding children and autism, I think I understand, I have feelings, and I have differentiated feelings.<br>Every time I got lost in the past, I didn’t take any photos. How could I bother to take photos? Now my mood is different. I searched all the way to take pictures, catch up on the 10,000 steps to be completed today, and also took the time to eat a bowl of noodles. A colleague bumped into me and asked me what I was doing. I smiled and said that my son was lost and I was looking for him. My colleague looked puzzled. I said it was okay, so I left and kept walking and looking. The department leaders and colleagues were also anxious, but they could definitely see that I was stable and relaxed, and I was smiling all the time.<br>I keep laughing, because this day will come sooner or later. If you want to grow up and enter the society, this kind of thing will come sooner or later. It’s better to come than not to come at all, and it’s better to come early than to come late. I’m laughing in my heart. Once you have security and trust, you should go out into society alone. What is sociality? It’s nothing more than a person leaving early and coming back late.<br>When I left my workplace to finish my noodles and walked 200 meters south, I took a photo with my phone of a store on the roadside that Hamp often paid attention to. At a glance, I saw a figure among the people queuing up in front of Zhengxin Chicken Steak and subconsciously came into view, it was him! He stood in front of the stall and ordered barbecue and chicken steaks, and the boss obeyed and cooked them for him.<br>I took photos. I tapped Hamp on the shoulder and smiled. I smiled and said I have been looking for you for three hours, where have you gone? Hamp was still holding a piece of pineapple in his hand, which he had already eaten half of. The boss handed two skewers of barbecue to him. He also wanted chicken steaks and bought them too. After I paid the money, I asked him where are you going? Hamp looked at me and didn’t answer, because it was hard to answer. why? He originally went to my workplace to look for me, but now that he met me, he stopped going to my work. I asked him where he was going. It was difficult for him to answer. I changed my approach and asked : Are you looking for your father at work? He said yes. I’m still not convinced, I still feel like the communication was not successful. I asked, where is it up there? He said Quarantine(my workplace). It seems that he does know that , which proves that he is really coming to find me.<br>I saw him carrying the backpack I usually carry, and in the backpack were his things that he had packed. He still had his coat draped over one arm. When Teacher Peng returned to the studio, he told us that Hamp had taken the coat away. This proved that Hamp had something in mind and he wanted to take the things home or go to his father. When Hamp was buying barbecue, he stole someone else’s queue. The young man behind him got angry and left without buying. The boss seemed helpless. I explained that there was something different about my child, which confused my boss even more. The boss really couldn’t tell that Hamp was different from normal people, because all the responses were fluent, and the communication when buying things was smooth, natural and firm. Hamp wanted to buy two barbecue skewers and chicken steaks, and he communicated naturally.<br>I posted the Hamp’s photo of queuing up to buy barbecue to the studio group. Hamp’s mom was relieved immediately. We walked a few meters south and came to a tricycle fruit stall, and Hamp said he wanted watermelon. This is where I got the pineapple just now. I gave the boss some extra money, and he was a good person. A person next to me came over and said that the boss was a good person. Yes, there are good people everywhere in society, and this is the basis for children’s recovery.<br>How bold a person is, how productive the land is. For Hamp, that’s exactly what happened. As Hamp’s abilities become higher and higher, the society he faces will inevitably become wider and wider. There is nothing outside the heart. As the heart becomes bigger, there will be more and more things in the heart. I had to find ways to ensure the most basic safety, such as putting a locator watch in my backpack and letting him fly. The kite needs to be flown, and at the same time, the string in your hand cannot be broken.<br>We entered the Jixiangcun subway station and passed the security check channel in front of Hamp. The two little girls at the security check looked at Hamp and murmured to each other in surprise, as if they had discovered something but were not sure. I smiled and said, found him. They are cute and smile brightly. Everyone is paying attention, this is our society.<br>Give your children a chance to go out early and come home late. This opportunity should gradually become normal. This is the real road to recovery. Are many people avoiding this path? Is there a road to recovery other than this? Regardless of recovery, everyone has to enjoy it happily, right?<br>Hamp left the studio at 16:00, and it was 18:30 when we met . It took him 2 and a half hours to walk a little more than 1 kilometer? I walked to my workplace at this speed and I’ll be off from work too! What did he do every moment during these two and a half hours? If there are photos, I would be willing to pay for them! I especially want to see it.<br>When I got back to bed at night, Hamp’s big meal came. He used my phone to type and look for things, look through photos, and take pictures of the boxes of pill boxes he bought. Taking photos, this method really made Hamp more and more aware. The advantage of photos is that they are more convincing than words. If a child who cannot speak can be taught to speak, the words he will say are things that normal people would not say. This is the disadvantage of speaking itself. Photos avoid this drawback.<br>How to promote children? Keep things simple and repetitive, not complicated and empty.<br>Hamp can recite a lot of the language from cartoons without even realizing it! Therefore, PPT must keep up.<br>Hamp can pack up independently and come to see me at work. This opportunity must become a normal thing. Next time, let Teacher Peng tell Hamp to find his father, while I hide and follow him.</p>

    <title>How to Enhance Language Skills in Children with Autism？</title>
    <url>/2023/09/29/test06/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Video 1: Hamp asked me to go out and pack food for him.</p>
<p>Video 2: Hamp asked me to go to Walmart to buy something for him.</p>
<p>This is a question and answer between Hamp and myself. The medium of communication between Hamp and I includes both verbal and non-verbal. It can be seen that his language is normal and natural. His expressions, eyes, micro-behaviors and other non-verbal expressions are normal and natural. There are no traces of formal training in his verbal or non-verbal language, because I got rid of formal training very early on.<br>Non-verbal means active thinking, and Hamp’s non-verbal is good.<br>Hampu started training when he was three years old and two months old, and he trained for 8 months, mainly imitating movements and imitating speech. Then I discovered the problem! Because no matter what I say, I want the child to think, but he just repeats my words or the last few words of the words, and then he thinks that the task is completed and he can get the reinforcer, and his brain is no longer thinking. .<br>I say something, he says something, and then he gets reinforcement. This is my form training for these 8 months. This instills a form of imitation in the child, which hinders his thinking, because what he thinks is that if he says the same thing as his father, he will solve the problem and get reinforcers, which prevents him from thinking about my words. meaning.<br>It took me two years to get rid of my child’s imitation. At that time, I didn’t have the technology I have now, so I mainly used my mouth to get rid of the imitation, so it took a long time. It took me two years to get him to stop imitating. When he was more than 6 years old, his awareness and habit of imitating speech finally disappeared, his active speaking was activated, and he finally started to use his brain instead of just imitating speech.<br>How to improve children’s communication level?<br>Communication includes both verbal and non-verbal. The emphasis is on non-verbal. Never teach your children questions and answers through your mouth. The words that come out of the mouth are names, and names come from children’s own breakthroughs, not through formal indoctrination to make children memorize routines. Only when children have inner clarity and self-breakthrough of reputation barriers can they have good language.<br>Imitation movement training is useless and harmful because it instills in children the consciousness and habit of imitating other people’s behaviors. As a result, the children lose themselves and their own opinions, and they lose their own active thinking.<br>Imitation training is basically useless and very harmful. What are the benefits of imitation training? I guess it’s just a little bit, so that children can imitate parrots early, because the vocal organs are used or lost. Will the vocal organs degenerate if they are not used for a long time? I guess parents are worried about this. As long as the child speaks, even if it is a parrot, the parents will feel that a stone has fallen in their hearts. But is it too much worry and anxiety? Is the child’s crying and screaming also training the vocal organs? I don’t understand this.<br>Moreover, we can train to speak proactively! You can still say it as early as possible and if it is meaningful, isn’t it the best of both worlds?<br>To sum up, let’s talk about consistent training, that is, whatever I say, you will say whatever. This is basically unnecessary. The purpose of consistent speaking in pictures and consistent speaking in mind is also to speak out words, and to speak meaningful words, which can avoid parroting caused by consistent speaking training.<br>How to make pictures and descriptions consistent? How to be consistent? This is what I’ve been working on.<br>I remember one thing very clearly: that day, Hamp and I met with an old parent and her autistic child, Xiao A. Hamp was about 8 years old at the time, and Xiao A was about 20 years old. Xiao A was holding a cake with wrapping paper in his hand. Hamp snatched it away and ate it. Xiao A didn’t know what to do.<br>Mom said, “Whose thing is this?”<br>Xiao Jia said: “Mine.”<br>Mom said, “What should you do?”<br>Xiao Jia said: “I should snatch it back!”<br>Mom said, “It’s not loud enough!”<br>Xiao Jia made a cheering gesture and raised his voice, but there was obvious weakness in his voice. He said, “I want to get it back!”<br>In this scene, the mother is training her child in formality, and if she is following the formality, it is not as natural as Hamp who has not been trained in formality! After they finished the formality, Hamp also finished the cake, and Hamp stuffed the remaining paper wrapping the cake back into Xiao A’s hand. The scene is over.<br>This thing has always been in my mind. At that time, I felt that form training was worse than no training, because instinct is the most natural and normal. Moreover, Xiao A is mild and Hamp is moderately severe. I think Xiao A is not as normal as Hamp, but I couldn’t come up with a solution at that time. Only now do I understand that it turns out that I have to do good non-verbal stuff.<br>How to do good non-verbal work?<br>Yu’s mom: “Hi Dad, I watched your video lecture. It’s so exciting. Children have needs and things have functions. People without language barriers can understand what they say. However, our children have barriers, so we need to film the children’s initiative. The needs and functions of objects in behavior. When he watched the photos and videos, he just walked the chain and expressed it. Finally, he understood that it is awareness and clarity to make children act in unison. He understood that children’s initiative will come from scratch. Parents’ non-verbal expressions It’s the environment. Children can enter the photo chain video and the channel is open. This is my understanding.<br>“After watching your explanation video, I feel that I have ideas for taking pictures. The child has experience. What is missing is the non-verbal channel. When I take pictures with his initiative, I will understand him better and understand that you need to use non-verbal means. He expressed that the child’s language disorder depends on the parents’ non-verbal expression, so that he can calm down and persist in doing simple things.<br>“When children grow up, they have no initiative anymore. If they are stupid or crazy, blame them. Only by following your example can you understand the children’s obstacles. Parents will do it only after they understand. Sometimes it is hard to let go of children, especially when they are older. It is very difficult for parents. I can’t clearly see whether my children are good or bad. I can see my children living a happy life, so I try my best to see my children live a happy life! I am also happy!<br>“Only when parents practice the difficulties of being mute in life can they understand their children’s obstacles. Video explanations can help parents understand more deeply and do better.”<br>This is Yuma’s understanding of my video explanation. She accurately explained an important method! Parents should improve their non-verbal expression skills. Parents should create a non-verbal expression environment.<br>How to teach question and answer?<br>There are two types of question and answer, open mouth and closed mouth. We are going to do closed mouth question and answer.<br>How to do a Q&amp;A that shuts up?<br>Parents should improve their non-verbal expression skills and create a non-verbal expression environment. Parents have improved their non-verbal expression skills. When they want to convey a meaning to their children, they can make a non-verbal expression tool for this meaning. The children will understand what the parents mean at a glance, and the communication will be successful. Successful communication is conducive to the development of active language.</p>

    <title>A Letter from a Parent of an Autistic Child to Mr.Hamp&#39;s Father</title>
    <url>/2023/10/17/test07/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>To Mr. Hamp’s Father,<br>I want to express my deepest gratitude to you. Ever since my child was diagnosed with autism in April, I’ve been living in a state of constant anxiety. If it weren’t for the concern I hold for my younger child, just 60 days old at the time, I might have been unable to cope with the despair and even contemplated ending it all. This is how my life was back then.<br>In April, my child had very limited language skills, merely mimicking words. His behavior and emotional issues were particularly severe. However, fate had a plan. A compassionate parent recommended your Lecture courses to me, and that’s when my bewildering journey of learning began. Initially, I wasn’t sure what I was learning, and I often asked you questions about my child’s issues, like biting and tantrums. Looking back, I realize that these were trivial concerns compared to what I would come to understand. Nevertheless, I am deeply thankful for your unwavering patience in addressing my often trivial inquiries.<br>In the beginning, I couldn’t make heads or tails of your Lecture courses, which left me feeling disheartened. However, I didn’t give up. I bought your books and DVDs and resumed my learning journey. Suddenly, it all started making sense. I began applying what I was learning to my child. Over the past three months, as I continued to study, reflect, and apply these principles, my child has made tremendous progress.<br>He now understands the principle of consistency, content communication, love, patience, waiting, and emotional expression. He is becoming more and more emotionally balanced. Many of his previous problematic behaviors have vanished. New issues that arise are swiftly addressed and resolved. He is now eating independently and sleeping alone. In short, my child’s recent progress fills me with joy and excitement.<br>In just three months, not only has my child changed because of these principles, but I have changed as well. As you often say, when you solidify the words, a child will start expressing themselves in sentences. The chain of active behaviors is getting longer.<br>But let me emphasize this: you saved me and my child. With you as our guide, I am filled with confidence and courage as we continue our journey. As you have said, when the words are solidified, the child will often start expressing themselves in sentences. We are sincerely grateful to you for helping us navigate this path.<br>You once said, “What saves the child is the child’s mother; what saves the mother is still the mother.” Having a child with autism is not a disaster, but not knowing how to guide that child is the true tragedy. You discovered your child’s autism and didn’t uproot your life. Instead, you chose to maintain your normal life, which was a courageous decision. Not straying from your regular life is something I highly endorse, and it’s the right path.<br>I hope my experiences can prevent you and your child from feeling helpless. My lectures, my books, my articles are all invaluable guideposts. These guideposts were given to me by God!<br>In closing, as the saying goes, “When heaven shows mercy, even old age is not a burden.” There is no rush; everything must be thought out. Respect your child as an individual with autism. Respect their developmental path. They can normalize, and they can even surpass the average person. I’d like to quote a passage from one of my previous writings: “I have been educating my child for many years, and I’ve made some progress and achievements. However, I am just conforming to the objective development pattern of a child with autism. This objective pattern is real and exists independently. It is not something that can be manipulated by people. I have not done anything. I don’t take credit for it because I haven’t done anything. I don’t have anything to lose. What could I lose? I never had it in the first place. That’s what Laozi meant when he said ‘being born yet not possessing.’”<br>One parent told me, “Mr.Guo, my thoughts are the same as most parents. I just want my child to be like the other kids, not so different. And everything I have learned from books and the internet has been about making my child just like the others. Every word you say makes me feel guilty. I didn’t help my child, but I became an obstacle on his path to progress.” These words broke my heart. I felt the pain, the pain of the child, but more so, the pain of the parents.<br>Thank you for your acquaintance! We are not alone on this journey.<br>Sincerely, </p>

    <title>Returning to Peking University Sixth Hospital After Eight Years</title>
    <url>/2023/10/29/test08/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>Eight years ago, when Hamp was 3 years old and 2 months old, on September 16, 2008, we took Hamp to the Sixth Hospital of Peking University for medical treatment. The doctor spent 30 minutes with Hamp and diagnosed him with moderate autism. Our family stayed in the Keyuan Hotel opposite the Sixth Hospital. The accommodation there was very cheap and there were no windows in the room. I feel like I am a beggar in this huge city. My college classmates came to see me and chatted with me for a long time, hoping that I would be more open-minded. I don’t have the ability to look away. The pressure of Autistic disease is like a mountain weighing me down so much that I can’t breathe. I never thought that I would encounter disability, but the impossible happened anyway. Eight years later, today is December 3, 2016. My children and I came to Peking University Sixth Hospital again after eight years. However, this time, we are not here to see a doctor, but to attend the Cross-Strait Autism Symposium. In the Yifu Building in the courtyard, my children and I went to have this meeting. Hanpu also has a name tag, and Guo Hanpu’s name is also written on the ticket. He is no longer a spectator, he is also an invitee. Hamp walked straight to his seat and sat down, looking so rude and like a big-name celebrity. Hamp’s father, named Hamp Daddy, also spoke at the meeting for 30 minutes. Hamp made his dad. We stayed in a hotel in the compound, and the conditions were much better than last time. The room has a window. The accommodation fee is also paid by the conference organizer. After the afternoon session ended, while walking with my children along the road outside the hospital compound, I suddenly noticed a small alley across the street. It bore the inscription “Keyuanbin,” with the word “Guan” missing. This sight brought back previous feelings, yet I managed to suppress my surprise. In this sprawling city, even as a newcomer, I felt I could find my place and no longer felt like an outsider.<br>This time, we refrained from entering the outpatient clinic building and instead revisited the hospital’s entrance. At the gate of Peking University Sixth Hospital, I took a photo of Han Pu. Over the past years, Hamp had grown taller, transitioning into a teenager. He had slimmed down, appearing thinner than before, but his facial expression remained as radiant as it was eight years ago. I’ve strived to minimize any secondary trauma Hamp had experienced and preserved the sunny disposition he had back then to the best of my ability. During these eight years, I’ve avoided unnecessary detours and significantly minimized the impact of rigorous, rigid metaphysical training on my child. As a result, the brightness and warmth of his smile haven’t been dimmed by years of training; it remains as sunny and radiant as ever.</p>
<p>Today, I feel an entirely different sense of empowerment, as if I’ve successfully trampled autism under my feet, shattering it to pieces. The overwhelming suffocation I experienced eight years ago due to my son’s autism is no longer present. The inconceivable has transpired. Man is resolute in challenging fate, and the predestined path is not absolute; it’s shaped by human hands.<br>Of the six core areas—emotions, sleep, diet, exercise, comprehension, and expression—my current focus is on controlling diet and exercise. I aim to condition my child’s body for robust health and instill positive living habits. Understanding and expressing aspects related to autism are no longer a concern.<br>This morning, after waking up, I massaged my child’s belly and ensured he drank water in our hotel room. He had a bowel movement, and I observed plant matter in his stool. Lately, I’ve persistently encouraged him to consume a variety of vegetables, and he has been cooperative. Despite feeling nauseated and tearful after eating green vegetables, he managed to consume them. The child has grown more sensible, comprehends my instructions, and is easier for me to care for.<br>In the evening, a few of us parents gathered for a small meal featuring Peking duck. Upon our return, Hamp and I walked back together. As we strolled through the capital’s streets, even though the thoroughfare was quiet, I felt a sense of mastery over the city. Returning to the hotel was smooth, and Hamp made it without difficulty. It seems that the technique of belly massages still works. I also realized that consuming meat leads to constipation.<br>I massaged the child’s belly . Subsequently, he fell asleep, and his breathing became gentle and calm.<br>During the meeting, I presented a report, the main essence of which is summarized below:<br>To aid Hamp in his recovery, I delved into understanding what he possessed and what he lacked. This quest demanded diligence, wisdom, and the refinement of human nature. Eventually, I realized that what I believed he lacked, he actually possessed. Even if he doesn’t have a towering tree, there is a seed within him aspiring towards growth into that towering tree. Did Hamp comprehend fractions before? No. However, he baked a cake, sliced it into four equal parts, then further divided those pieces into eight equal sections. That’s how he grasped the concept: a quarter equals two eighths, one equals four quarters, and one also equals eight eighths.<br>I previously thought that consciousness was the paramount factor, ability occupied the middle ground, and knowledge was at the foundation. Presently, I believe consciousness stands at the apex, repeated three times. From nothingness emerges the unit, and from the unit, all things naturally follow. The origin of the singular unit from nothingness is a fundamental process.<br>The title of my report is “Hamp’s Journey from Life to Books.” Neither life nor books take precedence; what’s vital is the transition from life to books. This concept resonates with the philosophical principles of Wang Yangming. It’s not about the quantity of what you hold within but the fluidity of your channels of expression. Instead of fixating on what the child doesn’t know, focus on what they already comprehend. By recognizing that the child possesses everything, they are no different from typical individuals.<br>I am an advocate for deductive learning. The child already holds a full score of 100 points. By subtracting just one point from him, he could potentially gain another. Hence, the child’s progress relies more on his father’s contribution than on the child himself.<br>There’s also an approach involving additive learning. Initially, I thought the child scored zero, so I taught him to score one, and he responded by giving me a score of one. Regrettably, I couldn’t effectively teach him in this manner.<br>A child can indeed acquire a skill and showcase proficiency, but how did they learn it? If the child explored and learned by themselves, it’s genuine. However, if they were compelled into the process, it remains superficial.<br>Home is where children truly belong. Observing how older children lack a place to go after completing elementary and junior high school, I aim to address the housing issue early on. Home is everything and provides a space for everything to happen.<br>The environment that becomes ingrained in a child’s heart is, undeniably, the environment. I believe I am moving in the right direction, consistently forging ahead. Despite the solitude, I shouldn’t look back; instead, I must continue to take another 10,000 steps forward. The journey is lengthy, and each step signifies progress. Pioneers may face solitude but are entrusted with the responsibilities of their era.<br>Eight years ago, there was a photo of me and my child at Tiananmen Square. The child’s innocent smile sharply contrasted with my somber expression. Reflecting on it now, the world itself isn’t at fault—I was merely troubling myself unnecessarily.<br>After 8 years, I’ve come to realize that what we term “autism” is just a part of normality. The label “autism” is fundamentally a misunderstanding.<br>Consider how many parents and their children still frequent hospitals today. What do they look like? I hope my experiences can alleviate the distress for more parents in similar situations.</p>

    <title>Trying to make an autistic child “become normal”—why is that doomed to be a dead end?</title>
    <url>/2025/12/22/test09/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>The reason autism makes it hard to survive in the world isn’t, at its core, that their way of thinking and behaving is unusual. It’s that they never truly get to develop a way of thinking that belongs to them.</p>
<p>From a young age, they’re subjected to a large amount of intervention and conditioning, with the goal of becoming—or getting close to—“ordinary people,” rather than understanding themselves and becoming themselves.</p>
<p>As a result, they can’t consistently use their own thinking to make sense of the world, and they can’t form ideas that are truly their own.</p>
<p>A person without their own thoughts is just a puppet on strings. Of course they can’t live independently.</p>
<p>When parents and society don’t accept a child’s “oddness,” the child can’t form an independent self, and independence becomes impossible.</p>
<p>So any attempt to “train” and “intervene” to make a child “normal like everyone else” is destined to be a dead end.</p>
<p>What autistic children truly need isn’t to “become normal,” but to “become at ease”—able to use their own senses to feel freely, think freely, and act freely.</p>
<p>Parents should do their best to ensure safety and health, and create an environment where the child can feel at ease. Only then can the child use their own self to experience and understand the world.</p>
<p>By preserving their neurodiversity—and making use of those diverse traits—they can ultimately live independently.</p>

    <title>I met Liu Mengyuan, and I saw Hamp’s future</title>
    <url>/2022/02/07/trans/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<p>A few pieces of pineapple cake were scattered on a desk in someone’s house in a certain community in a certain province, a certain city. It flew from Taiwan to Zhengzhou, and then took the high-speed train from Zhengzhou to someone’s home in Xi’an. I ate a piece, crispy on the outside and pear on the inside. I couldn’t help but eat another piece. I said I would stop eating after the last piece, and I ate the third piece. I simply agreed and ate two more pieces. My belly is also satisfied and satisfied. I need to be willful and satisfied. (In this paragraph, there are dots, chains, and trees, as well as “needs–active actions–satisfaction”, and the willfulness of doing things in unison.)<br>There is a girl who is seventeen years old and slim. She is from Taiwan. Her name is Liu Mengyuan. Mengyuan is an autistic child. Mengyuan’s mother, Ms. Chen Lan, flew with Mengyuan from Taiwan to Zhengzhou. In Kunda, I met their mother and daughter. Although our gathering lasted only two days, it gave me thoughts from ancient times. From this, I saw the infinite possibilities of this child Hamp in the future. I can imagine any limit, no limit. From this, I thought about the infinite possibilities for the future of autistic children in the world. I can imagine any way I want without any limit.<br>Pineapple cake is a gift given to me by Ms. Chen Lan. Most people call Ms. Chen Lan Teacher Chen, but I call her Mr. Chen Lan from the bottom of my heart. She is 53 years old and has been raising an autistic girl alone for 17 years. When Mengyuan was eight months old, her father passed away due to illness, and her mother raised the child alone. Seventeen years later, a daughter of the Liu family has now grown up. She is tall and graceful, has a quick mind, is handsome, and has sharp teeth. Wherever she goes, there is laughter and laughter, which is really endearing.<br>When Xiao Mengyuan was seven years old, she unfortunately contracted cancer. In the hospital, when the doctor told her that she could only live for three months, she sat on the ground without moving for half an hour. How she drove home later, she still can’t remember. During chemotherapy, she was lying on the hospital bed, looking for a place where she could entrust her dream.<br>How did a mother with cancer get through the past ten years with an autistic child? I can’t imagine. Yesterday, she told me that the tumor is still in her body, and that she and the tumor are good friends, they don’t bother each other and they forget each other. Her spirit permeates the universe, and her life span is equal to that of heaven. It is inconvenient for her to take care of herself now, but she drags such a body and travels to hundreds of lectures a year, which makes me awe and admire her, even though she looks only a little over 1.5 meters to me.<br>Her different life gave me different thoughts. If I use the word “success” to summarize it, I think this word is too frivolous. Mengyuan is not only ordinary, but also better than ordinary. She has rigorous thinking, clear expression and clear character. She has great music and she is our piano princess. She has held solo concerts many times.<br>When Mengyuan was three or four years old, she was watching a concert. She climbed onto the stage to play and was kicked off by the staff. Many people will think, in such a place, if an autistic child does not follow the rules, how will she integrate into society in the future? So you need to modify her behavior!<br>The last time Mengyuan held a solo concert, a three- or four-year-old child climbed onto the stage to play. When the staff wanted to kick the child off the stage, Mengyuan said don’t kick him out. He would be the next person to hold a solo concert.<br>Mengyuan said that she attended 33 kindergartens when she was a child, and was dropped out of school in the shortest two days. I asked her why you were dismissed? She said it was because they were ignorant. The principal of the 33rd kindergarten is the first invitee to the Mengyuan Concert. Although Mengyuan could not speak at the time, the first invitee to her first concert many years later was the principal of the 33rd kindergarten.<br>Mengyuan said to her mother that you always live for others, when will you live for yourself? When will you live a day for me? She advised her mother not to be so tired or worry so much. I told Mengyuan that my mother had lost herself for decades. My mother said that Mengyuan found herself when she was in the third grade of junior high school. I think that a person’s life is to find his inner self and return to his warm hometown. I think everyone is on their way back to themselves. For an autistic child, she had already achieved that.<br>Mengyuan summarized interpersonal relationships. She told her mother that there are four steps: the first time you are good to others, others are grateful; the second time you are good to others, don’t say thank you; the third time you forget to be good to others , others think you owe them; the fourth time you treat others badly, others will scold you. She told her mother to live for herself and not worry too much about other people’s affairs.<br>Some people say this doesn’t look like an autistic child. This is simply a normal person. Yes, I see that there is nothing abnormal about her now, and she has an excellent character that is extraordinary for ordinary people.<br>This time she came out to give a lecture and asked for leave from the school director. The school director disagreed and said that if she asks for leave again, she will exceed the allowed number of days and will expel you according to school regulations. Meng Yuan said that I went out to give lectures for public welfare and to do good deeds, not to make money. You have no right to expel me. You talk about the school rules, I talk about the law.<br>People are normal. Human hearts are normal. Mengyuan said that although she could not speak before she was six years old, her perception was normal. I have always believed that the hearts of autistic children are the same as those of ordinary children and are normal. It’s just that autistic children can’t think alike! Failure to get through the conflict early will cause harm to the child as he or she grows up.<br>Nana is a miniature girl. When Meng Yuan saw Nana for the first time, she exclaimed in unison, “Why are you so tall?” Then Meng Yuan came back to her senses and said, “You are different from me. Everyone is different.” They are different, everyone is unique, and uniqueness is excellence.” Yesterday, I saw them hugging each other, they were in love, and chatting happily.<br>Last night I returned to Xi’an from Zhengzhou, my third trip back from Kangda. Up to now, 24 hours and 15 minutes have passed. What I saw in Kangda has always been in front of my eyes, and what I heard has been lingering in my ears.<br>I met Mr. Wang Huan, a national first-class actor in Henan Opera. He is 75 years old this year. He is full of energy and looks like he is in his early 60s. He sang two pieces of Henan Opera for our meeting, and we went to dinner together. A dining table and several people are my role models.<br>The old man is a moral model. He has adopted seven orphans for 17 years, and some of the children have graduated from college at the age of 22. He funded an ALS patient in Xi’an with 250,000 yuan. In order to feed these orphans, he worked overtime and went to teahouses to earn extra money in addition to his normal performances, because he had 7 orphans to feed in his family. The main patient, who was injured at work due to long-term stress, had a heart problem and later underwent major heart surgery. The old man is awe-inspiring. I’m thinking that one day, I’ll also lead a team of autistic kids.<br>Sister Li Zhiping is in her fifties this year. She is one of the top ten outstanding mothers who moved China, an outstanding volunteer, a national model for learning from Lei Feng, etc. She gave me a business card that said “Serve the People.” Serving the people is also my life value. Pay tribute to Sister Li, she interpreted these five words.<br>Teacher Mou from Kangda Institution who often picks me up and drops me off is also a good person in my heart. He is the father of an autistic child who is not his biological child.<br>In addition to Teacher Chen Lan, I also admire Sister Zhang, the founder of Kangda. Having been engaged in the cause of autism for decades, Kangda has developed very well to what it is today. But at the age of fifty-three, she is still reading WeChat articles from unknown people like me. She has been determined to reform and move forward. If I didn’t have an autistic child, and if I was over 50 years old, would I work as hard as she does? I think this is the gap between me and her, and it is also the gap that I sincerely admire.<br>She said that an institution without an institution is the best institution, a teacher without a teacher is the best teacher, and training without training is the best training. This has been her goal for many years. Now she saw it in my WeChat article, and what I said was from her heart.<br>She invited me, Teacher Chen Lan, and Mengyuan to write a series of books called “Family Organization”. She said that she wrote from the perspective of reflection, I wrote from the perspective of heart-drawing pictures, Teacher Chen wrote from the perspective of natural guidance, and Meng Yuan wrote from the perspective of her growing up as an autistic child. It is also equipped with a set of CD-ROMs that explain the practical operation of the organization. She asked me to be the president of China Autism Network to give full play to my professional advantages.<br>Sister Zhang is a person who denies herself and constantly strives to move forward. I learn from her from the bottom of my heart.<br>I would also like to thank Teacher Chu and Teacher Yan for their help. Otherwise, how could I have met these role models? I’ve said before that channel is more important than content, and it’s really true. They are achieving others without reservation. pay tribute!<br>This “Family Organization” seminar and training session organized by Kangda was attended by many parents and was broadcast live on the China Autism Network.<br>I spoke for two hours and reviewed the shortcomings of many current practices. Most of the things such as imitation, imitation, counting, teaching shapes and colors, teaching classification, teaching rules, behavior modification, etc. can not be done, and it is harmful if done. I put forward a point - knowledge is poisonous. Teach carefully!<br>I talked about the consistency of heart and action, how to reveal the heart through action, and how to understand the knowledge in children’s hearts through action. Do children have colors in their hearts? Is there any addition or subtraction? This is what the heart is shown by doing. My method proves that the child has it in his heart. Doing is a looking glass, seeing all the knowledge points in the child’s heart.<br>Mengyuan talked about his own growth process and some opinions, which are highly consistent with my ideas and can be said to be seamless. An autistic child proves that the theory I summarized is correct, which will cheer up many parents who see me and Mengyuan speaking on the same stage. Some parents told me that a stone has finally fallen to the ground and they firmly followed me.<br>Mengyuan was drinking water on the bed in the hotel room, and her mother was worried that she would tip the cup and spill the water on the bed. Sure enough, it was spilled on the bed, and my mother said, “It’s okay, just ask the waiter to change it.” This sentence was something Mengyuan taught her mother before. In the past, my mother might talk about Meng Yuan emotionally. Meng Yuan told her mother that she should say: “It’s okay, just ask the waiter to change it.” Meng Yuan said that her mother was an expert who was educated by her. Mom said I raised your child.<br>Mengyuan said that he also asked me to play the piano. If you tell me to play the piano, otherwise I will punish you! This makes her very uncomfortable and disgusts her. If you tell me you are a piano princess, can you play a song for us? I feel very comfortable listening to it and I would be willing to do it. Mengyuan is teaching educators how to speak with positive energy. Mengyuan herself is full of positive energy and is a kind-hearted and sunny girl.<br>Mengyuan said there is a glass of water on the table. If I am thirsty, I will drink it. I don’t need you to order me to drink water. If you give me instructions to drink water, my arms will be stiff when I pick up the water. This verifies the correctness of what I said about the consistency of the mind’s actions. Only the actions of the mind that are consistent are natural, and those that are inconsistent with the mind’s actions are rigid.<br>Meng Yuan said there was still time to go to the toilet. I didn’t need to pee, but you forced me to go, and I had to go. My steps to go to the toilet were stiff. Actually, I think what she meant was don’t force me. I advocate exploring thinking in proactive behavior to achieve consensus. This idea is correct. There is no knowledge in passive behavior, which can only cause children to have problematic behaviors that strive for initiative.<br>Meng Yuan said that I drank water on the bed and sprinkled the water on the bed. I will know what to do next time and you don’t need to tell me.<br>Mom said that once Mengyuan took her mother’s car and drove on the highway for two hours, it was troublesome to go to the bathroom in the middle, so she told Mengyuan to go to the bathroom before getting on the highway, but Mengyuan didn’t want to go.<br>Mengyuan said that I have experienced it this time, and I will know what to do next time. You can also use the restroom on the highway. Isn’t there a service area? What Mengyuan said is exactly what I want. Otherwise, how would the children experience the function of using the toilet in the service area?<br>If you don’t give me a chance to practice this time, but give me rules in advance to abide by, it will be to avoid the trouble it will cause you, and at the same time, it will deprive me of my right to practice and the opportunity to experience growth in practice. This is exactly the kind of rules and behavior modification I am against.<br>The so-called behavior modification or rules are nothing more than parents who are afraid of trouble and ask their children in advance what to do or follow the so-called rules, thereby avoiding the trouble that may cause parents. Doing so deprives children of the opportunity to learn and grow in practice. It is true that learning is an upward spiral process. What is learning without spirals?<br>Behavior modification should be a learning process, not a game of interests. Give the learning process back to the children, this is my advice.<br>I remember driving Hamp to and from the institution when he was five or six years old. He was sitting in the back seat. I was driving on the road in Xi’an and Hamp was anxious to pee. What should I do? As long as we are of the same mind, a living person can still die of urination! Hamp peed directly on the ground in the back seat of the car.<br>The same thing happens all the time. Because I always forget to let him go to the toilet to pee when I go out.<br>One time, when Hamp needed to pee, I reached behind and rolled down the window. Of course, I couldn’t roll it down too much, otherwise what would I do if the baby fell out? A gap was exposed, and Hamp saw that he aimed his penis at the gap to pee outside, but he was not tall enough. Why does a rabbit bite when it’s anxious? Hamp became anxious. He immediately stood on the back seat and stood on tiptoe to urinate. I drove slowly because I was afraid of dropping him. I drove slowly, and there was a motorcade blocked behind me. The horns blaring one after another urging me were spectacular! I thought to myself, what’s so exciting about an autistic child peeing.<br>As things went on like this, Hamp learned to use a pulsating bottle to urinate into, and also learned to use a plastic bag to urinate into. He had to carry a plastic bag of urine because it would spill as soon as he put it away. So he learned to tie plastic bags. Tying plastic bags is a proactive behavior, and proactive behavior occurs because of needs and functions. This is learning methods based on needs and functions.<br>I couldn’t take photos of these scenes, but Hamp had seen so many photos that he could describe the scenes without photos. I asked him how many ways to pee in the car? Hamp said pulsing, Ziploc bags, windows, the ground.<br>The spiral in practice, this is the principle of learning. If we don’t do this, without learning, what will the children learn? Therefore, many children who undergo behavior modification live in passivity. When they lose initiative, they lose their souls, their thinking, their learning, and their growth. The more they are corrected, the worse the child becomes. Because correction means not letting children learn.<br>Spiral learning is something that can be found in books and is also spoken by Meng Yuan himself.<br>Don’t push me or I’ll go crazy.<br>Let me go, I know how.<br>Let me go and I will make progress on my own. Your behavior modification will not make me better, it will only make me crazier.<br>These three sentences should be remembered. In fact, this is what the principle of consistency in mind must be observed. People, those who can be themselves are happy people.<br>If you do it with consistency, you will gradually get better. This is behavior modification. I still hate the word correction.<br>Behavior modification and natural guidance are two realms, and my method is to naturally not guide. I am more extreme and more inaction. Under my ideas and methods, Hamp’s progress is increasing day by day.<br>Hamp was going out today, and I followed him. He went to the Dicos store on North Street and bought four kinds of chicken, and then went to the Burger King store for a burger. He wanted to eat two, and he wanted to eat mine too, but I wouldn’t let him eat, so he traded hamburgers with me. Why did he do it so proactively? He is of the same mind. By doing this, I sensed that what he was paying attention to was the taste and size. That’s what made the difference between the two of our burgers.<br>Some parents asked me, can I instill knowledge in their children? I said no! It means that it is not allowed for children in the basic stage. The child has all the knowledge in his heart, he just needs to express it.<br>How to express it using do? You have to think about it. For example, do children have addition and subtraction in mind? You can put three candies he likes in your pocket, take out one for him, and he won’t leave; take out another two for him, and he won’t leave. It shows that he knows the concepts of 3, 1, and 2 in his heart, because he does it in a consistent manner. Use your thoughts to stimulate the child’s mind, and the child will take the initiative to act. This is observing the mind through doing.<br>You indoctrinate your children from the outside in, which is harmful. You just want to teach your children some knowledge.<br>I lead the child from the inside out, and the child learns everything. Living independently is not a big deal, shopping is not a big deal, talking is not a big deal, and social independence is not a big deal. The sky for children’s future is big and blue, and they can be imagined without limit.<br>There are so many behavioral chains in children’s minds that making money to support the family is no longer a big deal.<br>Entertainment, life and work, for children, at least for Hamp, these three areas can reach the level of ordinary people. This is entirely possible in the near future.<br>Some people say how could Mengyuan be autistic? Was it a mistake? Do you see anything unusual about what she said or did? Look how rigorous her thinking is! As rigorous as a programmer.<br>I want to say that today’s dream is tomorrow’s Hanpu.<br>Meng Yuan wants to write a book. She wants to write about her growth, and I can comment on it. We jointly published a book.</p>

    <title>Doing and speaking in agreement opens the door for children</title>

Do not use it all the time, otherwise the child will form a dependency on instructions, lack of initiative, and form a misunderstanding of things.</p>
<p>I use these rounds in my daily life. Each round is to establish the thinking of doing and saying the same thing. It is best to teach children the thinking of doing and saying the same thing in a variety of rounds. Only then can children summarize the consistency thinking through these rounds. If the rounds given to children are single or stereotyped, and we do not do this round very well, then the child will form a misunderstanding of things, and thus show a dependence on instructions, lack of initiative to say and do, at this time, parents will say that the child is stereotyped. In fact, the child’s stereotypes are the reaction of our stereotyped teaching methods. There will be active reactions to live stimuli; dead stimuli will kill the reactions.</p>
<p>If children have mastered all of these rounds, then children will naturally pay attention to other people’s affairs. The training of children’s attention is improved through the shaping of thinking, not simply requiring children to look at them to understand. Let children understand people and things, and children will pay attention to people and things. We often do not know how to let children understand people and things, but only require them to pay attention to people and things. This is a manifestation of our lack of knowledge, not a problem with children.</p>
<p>Now, Hamp’s behavioral manifestations of consistency thinking are as follows:</p>
<p>He can read the lyrics of children’s songs by himself.<br>He can point and say the people and things in the children’s songs by himself, and he can also point them out to others.<br>When I come back after going out to buy buns, I ask him what I have in my hand, and he will say buns.<br>He will take the initiative to tell others what to do.<br>When others do and say, he will answer what others are doing when asked.<br>He can understand many of the instructions from others, even if he does not understand them, he knows to find the corresponding “doing” in the current scene.<br>Reminder: What is the goal of doing and saying the same thing with children? It is not just the content of saying and doing in doing and saying; more importantly, saying and doing are “consistent”. This is to open the channel for children. Education of children is more in the channel, not just in the content. Through the content, teach children the channel. After children master the channel, they can learn new content through the channel. This is the ability of induction and deduction.</p>
<p>We often point to something and describe it to the child. This is called pointing and saying. Pointing and saying is a kind of doing and saying. When we point to something, we must analyze and determine which part of the child sees this thing. This is behavior analysis. What did the child see after taking a look? We can only describe what he saw if we know what he saw. For example, if we take a red triangle and point it to the child, and the child looks at it, then what did the child see? Is it the color? Or the shape? Or the material? Only if I know that the child saw the color can I say red. If the child sees the shape, and I say red, then according to the principle of doing and saying the same thing, the child will think that this shape is called red. Seeing and saying the same thing is also a kind of doing and saying.</p>
<p>How to know what the child sees? I taught Hamp to take pictures. Hamp learned to take pictures, and the pictures he took were what he saw and wanted. He took pictures of the wheels of the bus, one complete, one half, one less half, and one more half. According to what he saw, using the channel of doing and saying the same thing, I told him what each of the things he saw was called, and he understood it once.</p>
<p>Here is a more concise translation:</p>
<p>**Doing and saying the same thing refers to the consistency between what we say and what we do. It is an important cognitive skill that can help children learn and grow.</p>
