It flew from Taiwan to Zhengzhou, and then took the high-speed train from Zhengzhou to someone’s home in Xi’an. I ate a piece, crispy on the outside and pear on the inside. I couldn’t help but eat another piece. I said I would stop eating after the last piece, and I ate the third piece. I simply agreed and ate two more pieces. My belly is also satisfied and satisfied. I need to be willful and satisfied. (In this paragraph, there are dots, chains, and trees, as well as “needs–active actions–satisfaction”, and the willfulness of doing things in unison.)<br>There is a girl who is seventeen years old and slim. She is from Taiwan. Her name is Liu Mengyuan. Mengyuan is an autistic child. Mengyuan’s mother, Ms. Chen Lan, flew with Mengyuan from Taiwan to Zhengzhou. In Kunda, I met their mother and daughter. Although our gathering lasted only two days, it gave me thoughts from ancient times. From this, I saw the infinite possibilities of this child Hamp in the future. I can imagine any limit, no limit. From this, I thought about the infinite possibilities for the future of autistic children in the world. I can imagine any way I want without any limit.<br>Pineapple cake is a gift given to me by Ms. Chen Lan. Most people call Ms. Chen Lan Teacher Chen, but I call her Mr. Chen Lan from the bottom of my heart. She is 53 years old and has been raising an autistic girl alone for 17 years. When Mengyuan was eight months old, her father passed away due to illness, and her mother raised the child alone. Seventeen years later, a daughter of the Liu family has now grown up. She is tall and graceful, has a quick mind, is handsome, and has sharp teeth. Wherever she goes, there is laughter and laughter, which is really endearing.<br>When Xiao Mengyuan was seven years old, she unfortunately contracted cancer. In the hospital, when the doctor told her that she could only live for three months, she sat on the ground without moving for half an hour. How she drove home later, she still can’t remember. During chemotherapy, she was lying on the hospital bed, looking for a place where she could entrust her dream.<br>How did a mother with cancer get through the past ten years with an autistic child? I can’t imagine. Yesterday, she told me that the tumor is still in her body, and that she and the tumor are good friends, they don’t bother each other and they forget each other. Her spirit permeates the universe, and her life span is equal to that of heaven. It is inconvenient for her to take care of herself now, but she drags such a body and travels to hundreds of lectures a year, which makes me awe and admire her, even though she looks only a little over 1.5 meters to me.<br>Her different life gave me different thoughts. If I use the word “success” to summarize it, I think this word is too frivolous. Mengyuan is not only ordinary, but also better than ordinary. She has rigorous thinking, clear expression and clear character. She has great music and she is our piano princess. She has held solo concerts many times.<br>When Mengyuan was three or four years old, she was watching a concert. She climbed onto the stage to play and was kicked off by the staff. Many people will think, in such a place, if an autistic child does not follow the rules, how will she integrate into society in the future? So you need to modify her behavior!<br>The last time Mengyuan held a solo concert, a three- or four-year-old child climbed onto the stage to play. When the staff wanted to kick the child off the stage, Mengyuan said don’t kick him out. He would be the next person to hold a solo concert.<br>Mengyuan said that she attended 33 kindergartens when she was a child, and was dropped out of school in the shortest two days. I asked her why you were dismissed? She said it was because they were ignorant. The principal of the 33rd kindergarten is the first invitee to the Mengyuan Concert. Although Mengyuan could not speak at the time, the first invitee to her first concert many years later was the principal of the 33rd kindergarten.<br>Mengyuan said to her mother that you always live for others, when will you live for yourself? When will you live a day for me? She advised her mother not to be so tired or worry so much. I told Mengyuan that my mother had lost herself for decades. My mother said that Mengyuan found herself when she was in the third grade of junior high school. I think that a person’s life is to find his inner self and return to his warm hometown. I think everyone is on their way back to themselves. For an autistic child, she had already achieved that.<br>Mengyuan summarized interpersonal relationships. She told her mother that there are four steps: the first time you are good to others, others are grateful; the second time you are good to others, don’t say thank you; the third time you forget to be good to others , others think you owe them; the fourth time you treat others badly, others will scold you. She told her mother to live for herself and not worry too much about other people’s affairs.<br>Some people say this doesn’t look like an autistic child. This is simply a normal person. Yes, I see that there is nothing abnormal about her now, and she has an excellent character that is extraordinary for ordinary people.<br>This time she came out to give a lecture and asked for leave from the school director. The school director disagreed and said that if she asks for leave again, she will exceed the allowed number of days and will expel you according to school regulations. Meng Yuan said that I went out to give lectures for public welfare and to do good deeds, not to make money. You have no right to expel me. You talk about the school rules, I talk about the law.<br>People are normal. Human hearts are normal. Mengyuan said that although she could not speak before she was six years old, her perception was normal. I have always believed that the hearts of autistic children are the same as those of ordinary children and are normal. It’s just that autistic children can’t think alike! Failure to get through the conflict early will cause harm to the child as he or she grows up.<br>Nana is a miniature girl. When Meng Yuan saw Nana for the first time, she exclaimed in unison, “Why are you so tall?” Then Meng Yuan came back to her senses and said, “You are different from me. Everyone is different.” They are different, everyone is unique, and uniqueness is excellence.” Yesterday, I saw them hugging each other, they were in love, and chatting happily.<br>Last night I returned to Xi’an from Zhengzhou, my third trip back from Kangda. Up to now, 24 hours and 15 minutes have passed. What I saw in Kangda has always been in front of my eyes, and what I heard has been lingering in my ears.<br>I met Mr. Wang Huan, a national first-class actor in Henan Opera. He is 75 years old this year. He is full of energy and looks like he is in his early 60s. He sang two pieces of Henan Opera for our meeting, and we went to dinner together. A dining table and several people are my role models.<br>The old man is a moral model. He has adopted seven orphans for 17 years, and some of the children have graduated from college at the age of 22. He funded an ALS patient in Xi’an with 250,000 yuan. In order to feed these orphans, he worked overtime and went to teahouses to earn extra money in addition to his normal performances, because he had 7 orphans to feed in his family. The main patient, who was injured at work due to long-term stress, had a heart problem and later underwent major heart surgery. The old man is awe-inspiring. I’m thinking that one day, I’ll also lead a team of autistic kids.<br>Sister Li Zhiping is in her fifties this year. She is one of the top ten outstanding mothers who moved China, an outstanding volunteer, a national model for learning from Lei Feng, etc. She gave me a business card that said “Serve the People.” Serving the people is also my life value. Pay tribute to Sister Li, she interpreted these five words.<br>Teacher Mou from Kangda Institution who often picks me up and drops me off is also a good person in my heart. He is the father of an autistic child who is not his biological child.<br>In addition to Teacher Chen Lan, I also admire Sister Zhang, the founder of Kangda. Having been engaged in the cause of autism for decades, Kangda has developed very well to what it is today. But at the age of fifty-three, she is still reading WeChat articles from unknown people like me. She has been determined to reform and move forward. If I didn’t have an autistic child, and if I was over 50 years old, would I work as hard as she does? I think this is the gap between me and her, and it is also the gap that I sincerely admire.<br>She said that an institution without an institution is the best institution, a teacher without a teacher is the best teacher, and training without training is the best training. This has been her goal for many years. Now she saw it in my WeChat article, and what I said was from her heart.<br>She invited me, Teacher Chen Lan, and Mengyuan to write a series of books called “Family Organization”. She said that she wrote from the perspective of reflection, I wrote from the perspective of heart-drawing pictures, Teacher Chen wrote from the perspective of natural guidance, and Meng Yuan wrote from the perspective of her growing up as an autistic child. It is also equipped with a set of CD-ROMs that explain the practical operation of the organization. She asked me to be the president of China Autism Network to give full play to my professional advantages.<br>Sister Zhang is a person who denies herself and constantly strives to move forward. I learn from her from the bottom of my heart.<br>I would also like to thank Teacher Chu and Teacher Yan for their help. Otherwise, how could I have met these role models? I’ve said before that channel is more important than content, and it’s really true. They are achieving others without reservation. pay tribute!<br>This “Family Organization” seminar and training session organized by Kangda was attended by many parents and was broadcast live on the China Autism Network.<br>I spoke for two hours and reviewed the shortcomings of many current practices. Most of the things such as imitation, imitation, counting, teaching shapes and colors, teaching classification, teaching rules, behavior modification, etc. can not be done, and it is harmful if done. I put forward a point - knowledge is poisonous. Teach carefully!<br>I talked about the consistency of heart and action, how to reveal the heart through action, and how to understand the knowledge in children’s hearts through action. Do children have colors in their hearts? Is there any addition or subtraction? This is what the heart is shown by doing. My method proves that the child has it in his heart. Doing is a looking glass, seeing all the knowledge points in the child’s heart.<br>Mengyuan talked about his own growth process and some opinions, which are highly consistent with my ideas and can be said to be seamless. An autistic child proves that the theory I summarized is correct, which will cheer up many parents who see me and Mengyuan speaking on the same stage. Some parents told me that a stone has finally fallen to the ground and they firmly followed me.<br>Mengyuan was drinking water on the bed in the hotel room, and her mother was worried that she would tip the cup and spill the water on the bed. Sure enough, it was spilled on the bed, and my mother said, “It’s okay, just ask the waiter to change it.” This sentence was something Mengyuan taught her mother before. In the past, my mother might talk about Meng Yuan emotionally. Meng Yuan told her mother that she should say: “It’s okay, just ask the waiter to change it.” Meng Yuan said that her mother was an expert who was educated by her. Mom said I raised your child.<br>Mengyuan said that he also asked me to play the piano. If you tell me to play the piano, otherwise I will punish you! This makes her very uncomfortable and disgusts her. If you tell me you are a piano princess, can you play a song for us? I feel very comfortable listening to it and I would be willing to do it. Mengyuan is teaching educators how to speak with positive energy. Mengyuan herself is full of positive energy and is a kind-hearted and sunny girl.<br>Mengyuan said there is a glass of water on the table. If I am thirsty, I will drink it. I don’t need you to order me to drink water. If you give me instructions to drink water, my arms will be stiff when I pick up the water. This verifies the correctness of what I said about the consistency of the mind’s actions. Only the actions of the mind that are consistent are natural, and those that are inconsistent with the mind’s actions are rigid.<br>Meng Yuan said there was still time to go to the toilet. I didn’t need to pee, but you forced me to go, and I had to go. My steps to go to the toilet were stiff. Actually, I think what she meant was don’t force me. I advocate exploring thinking in proactive behavior to achieve consensus. This idea is correct. There is no knowledge in passive behavior, which can only cause children to have problematic behaviors that strive for initiative.<br>Meng Yuan said that I drank water on the bed and sprinkled the water on the bed. I will know what to do next time and you don’t need to tell me.<br>Mom said that once Mengyuan took her mother’s car and drove on the highway for two hours, it was troublesome to go to the bathroom in the middle, so she told Mengyuan to go to the bathroom before getting on the highway, but Mengyuan didn’t want to go.<br>Mengyuan said that I have experienced it this time, and I will know what to do next time. You can also use the restroom on the highway. Isn’t there a service area? What Mengyuan said is exactly what I want. Otherwise, how would the children experience the function of using the toilet in the service area?<br>If you don’t give me a chance to practice this time, but give me rules in advance to abide by, it will be to avoid the trouble it will cause you, and at the same time, it will deprive me of my right to practice and the opportunity to experience growth in practice. This is exactly the kind of rules and behavior modification I am against.<br>The so-called behavior modification or rules are nothing more than parents who are afraid of trouble and ask their children in advance what to do or follow the so-called rules, thereby avoiding the trouble that may cause parents. Doing so deprives children of the opportunity to learn and grow in practice. It is true that learning is an upward spiral process. What is learning without spirals?<br>Behavior modification should be a learning process, not a game of interests. Give the learning process back to the children, this is my advice.<br>I remember driving Hamp to and from the institution when he was five or six years old. He was sitting in the back seat. I was driving on the road in Xi’an and Hamp was anxious to pee. What should I do? As long as we are of the same mind, a living person can still die of urination! Hamp peed directly on the ground in the back seat of the car.<br>The same thing happens all the time. Because I always forget to let him go to the toilet to pee when I go out.<br>One time, when Hamp needed to pee, I reached behind and rolled down the window. Of course, I couldn’t roll it down too much, otherwise what would I do if the baby fell out? A gap was exposed, and Hamp saw that he aimed his penis at the gap to pee outside, but he was not tall enough. Why does a rabbit bite when it’s anxious? Hamp became anxious. He immediately stood on the back seat and stood on tiptoe to urinate. I drove slowly because I was afraid of dropping him. I drove slowly, and there was a motorcade blocked behind me. The horns blaring one after another urging me were spectacular! I thought to myself, what’s so exciting about an autistic child peeing.<br>As things went on like this, Hamp learned to use a pulsating bottle to urinate into, and also learned to use a plastic bag to urinate into. He had to carry a plastic bag of urine because it would spill as soon as he put it away. So he learned to tie plastic bags. Tying plastic bags is a proactive behavior, and proactive behavior occurs because of needs and functions. This is learning methods based on needs and functions.<br>I couldn’t take photos of these scenes, but Hamp had seen so many photos that he could describe the scenes without photos. I asked him how many ways to pee in the car? Hamp said pulsing, Ziploc bags, windows, the ground.<br>The spiral in practice, this is the principle of learning. If we don’t do this, without learning, what will the children learn? Therefore, many children who undergo behavior modification live in passivity. When they lose initiative, they lose their souls, their thinking, their learning, and their growth. The more they are corrected, the worse the child becomes. Because correction means not letting children learn.<br>Spiral learning is something that can be found in books and is also spoken by Meng Yuan himself.<br>Don’t push me or I’ll go crazy.<br>Let me go, I know how.<br>Let me go and I will make progress on my own. Your behavior modification will not make me better, it will only make me crazier.<br>These three sentences should be remembered. In fact, this is what the principle of consistency in mind must be observed. People, those who can be themselves are happy people.<br>If you do it with consistency, you will gradually get better. This is behavior modification. I still hate the word correction.<br>Behavior modification and natural guidance are two realms, and my method is to naturally not guide. I am more extreme and more inaction. Under my ideas and methods, Hamp’s progress is increasing day by day.<br>Hamp was going out today, and I followed him. He went to the Dicos store on North Street and bought four kinds of chicken, and then went to the Burger King store for a burger. He wanted to eat two, and he wanted to eat mine too, but I wouldn’t let him eat, so he traded hamburgers with me. Why did he do it so proactively? He is of the same mind. By doing this, I sensed that what he was paying attention to was the taste and size. That’s what made the difference between the two of our burgers.<br>Some parents asked me, can I instill knowledge in their children? I said no! It means that it is not allowed for children in the basic stage. The child has all the knowledge in his heart, he just needs to express it.<br>How to express it using do? You have to think about it. For example, do children have addition and subtraction in mind? You can put three candies he likes in your pocket, take out one for him, and he won’t leave; take out another two for him, and he won’t leave. It shows that he knows the concepts of 3, 1, and 2 in his heart, because he does it in a consistent manner. Use your thoughts to stimulate the child’s mind, and the child will take the initiative to act. This is observing the mind through doing.<br>You indoctrinate your children from the outside in, which is harmful. You just want to teach your children some knowledge.<br>I lead the child from the inside out, and the child learns everything. Living independently is not a big deal, shopping is not a big deal, talking is not a big deal, and social independence is not a big deal. The sky for children’s future is big and blue, and they can be imagined without limit.<br>There are so many behavioral chains in children’s minds that making money to support the family is no longer a big deal.<br>Entertainment, life and work, for children, at least for Hamp, these three areas can reach the level of ordinary people. This is entirely possible in the near future.<br>Some people say how could Mengyuan be autistic? Was it a mistake? Do you see anything unusual about what she said or did? Look how rigorous her thinking is! As rigorous as a programmer.<br>I want to say that today’s dream is tomorrow’s Hanpu.<br>Meng Yuan wants to write a book. She wants to write about her growth, and I can comment on it. We jointly published a book.</p>
